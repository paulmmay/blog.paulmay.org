The band have released the official announcement following the break-up. Here it is:

> After six great years as a band, touring and making records, Ben Folds Five is calling it quits. Alan Wolmark, the band's manager, says that the split is amicable and that the decision was made because all three members felt the band had run its musical course and wanted to pursue other musical interests.

> As Ben Folds confirms "The band is splitting on good terms. We are very proud of our three albums, our little hit and our audience. Now it is time to bow out with dignity rather than to make that final 'cash-in' record and tour which, of course, is very tempting."

> Ben Folds has written, recorded and produced the song, "Lonely Christmas Eve," for the film "How The Grinch Stole Christmas," opening later this month and for the soundtrack CD out next week. In addition, "Wandering", another new song written, recorded and produced by Ben Folds, will be in the forthcoming independent film "100 Girls." Folds, who lives in Australia with his wife and twins, is currently in the studio recording a new album with producer Ben Grosse for release on Epic Records in the spring.

> Darren Jessee is assembling a band and has been playing his own new material on the New York club circuit for the past year. Robert Sledge is currently putting together a new group and producing bands in his Chapel Hill, North Carolina studio. Sledge has also been touring with ex-Squirrel Nut Zippers Tom Maxwell and his band The Minor Drag.

> Ben Folds Five and their crew would like to thank all their loyal fans who have made them feel comfortable and welcome throughout the world where they have been fortunate enough to visit and entertain.

Thanks to all of you who have mailed me over the last few days. I also got a very nice mail from Ben, and he was happy with the way it had ended, and to be moving on to new things. As I said in my Armchair post, this is a new beginning for three talented musicians. All the best.
