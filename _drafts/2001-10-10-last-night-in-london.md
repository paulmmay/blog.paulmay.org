<p class="intro">The last night of our Accenture-sponsored adventures in London.</p>
It's been a very busy few weeks, and we're leaving London tomorrow. London is great, it's vast compared to Dublin, it's cosmopolitan, and you get a sense of being in a place where even if you saw something new every day it'd take you an awful long time to get bored of the place. On the downside, London is expensive. I think if you were being paid in sterling it'd be no more expensive than Dublin (which is also _damn_ expensive)&#8230;unfortunately the Euro has the value of magic beans here&#8230;with the magic removed for safety purposes.

A cracking few weeks. Some of my colleagues have been burning the candle at both ends (waking up in train stations in the middle of the night for example), but we've all come out of it intact. So, one more night out, a wrap-up day in training, a quick flight, a day in Dublin, then on to Chicago. Hopefully, another good few weeks ahead.
