I've spent the last few weeks working on the new design for the page, and on putting some new content together. There are some new features too, including lots more song for the real audio page and a contact page to get in touch with me, and a random lyric generator in the nav-bar. There are a few things that I'm still working on including a web-poll, and a guestbook, but they'll be up soon. The People on the Armchair page has been revamped too, and I've added everybody who was in the queue. I hope you all like the new look! If you find any mistakes, broken links, omissions etc., get in touch through the contact page. Thanks!
