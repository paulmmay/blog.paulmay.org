The US tour has officially finished, and hopefully the band are taking a well deserved break from the road. Robert Sledge will be touring minus Ben and Darren for a while starting from the end of May. He'll be touring with Tom Maxwell (Formerly with Squirrel Nut Zippers) and The Minor Drag. Check out the tour dates page for details.
