Sorry about the lack of updates in the last couple of weeks. I'm been sitting exams, and working on a few new features for the page. Things have been kinda quiet on the news front lately too. (The Armchair has been very quiet!) The tour in April is shaping up, and the band will be making some media appearances including the US "Trackers" show (On the Oxygen Network) to coincide with the tour. Hopefully more info will be available soon.
