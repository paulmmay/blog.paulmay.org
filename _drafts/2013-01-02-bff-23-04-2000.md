The tour in the States is still going on, and new tour dates for Japan have been announced. Justin Parlette has taken it upon himself to start a BFF newsletter. The first issue will be released around early June. I'll be doing some web-site reviews and acting as European corespondent....yay! MA2K is approaching fast too. The 2000th issue of our beloved Magical Armchair digest will be upon us in a few days, and the winner of the MA2k competition will be receiving lots of goodies from Frank Maynard and the band.
