In a recent project at <a href="http://www.mskcc.org">Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</a> I 	was asked to create new educational materials for bone marrow transplant patients. 

Most people arrive at the hospital with no special knowledge of cancer or medicine, but the educational materials they are given need to contain some medical terminology. I decided that I needed an objective, automated way to identify medical terms and other obscure words in text that I was reading and writing. I could then explain these words (e.g. include them in a glossary of terms) or replace them with simpler words.

I created a simple web service that does just this - <a href="http://jrgn.paulmay.org">Jargonator</a> takes a piece of text and highlights words that don't appear in standard, written English. 

I am continuing to add small improvements to the service and would love to hear any comments or suggestions.
