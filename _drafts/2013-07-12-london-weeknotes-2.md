Not too much to report this week. I've been continuing to get set up in London, and have been working on some early plans for two new projects. 

Tonight I'm off to Dublin for a flying visit - I'll be in Longford at a wedding tomorrow, then back in Dublin for a few hours on Sunday. 

### Quickies
* I bought a Windows laptop to use as my work computer. It's ugly.
* I finally bought a scanner that can scan negatives, slides/positives.
* I have not done any of my linear algebra coursework this week.
* I am 68% of the way through 1Q84.
