Week 7 blurs into week 8. After a couple of months of very hard work, Cliona has found a great job in Oxford. Oxford is about an hour North of London, so over the next few weeks we'll be moving up there from our temporary digs in Hackney. Today we finished the paperwork for a little house we're going to rent in central Oxford. 

Even though I'll be back here regularly, I am a little sad to be leaving London. It's a fascinating city, a grubby city, a very real city - different from New York, but sharing a sense of infinite possibility. I have really enjoyed the couple of months here. 

Work is going well. We made a couple of significant steps forward on a machine-learning projects last week. I am designing and building some simple, useful little products. Even though we're a long way from finished, I am proud of the work we've done.

That's all for now. I'll write about our move to Oxford in the coming days and weeks.
