<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31225984/">Comparative effectiveness analyses</a> using an electronic medical record.
<!-- Our framework offers an accurate and user-friendly interface for identifying and extracting EMR data that can be used to create synthetic clinical trials. Additional studies are needed to validate this approach in other patient cohorts, replicate our findings, and leverage this methodology to improve patient care and accelerate drug development. -->

<p><a href="https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/113058/abstract">A virtual clinical trial</a> comparing pemetrexed and gemcitabine, both given with cisplatin, in patients with lung adenocarcinomas.</p>
<!-- We created a system that can identify a patient cohort by extracting structured cancer and outcomes data from the EMR, algorithmically identifying chemotherapy regimens, and using natural language processing to extract functional and smoking status from physician notes. Using the earlier clinical trial’s eligibility criteria, we identified a patient cohort and analyzed survival on an intent-to-treat basis. Our analysis relied on the extensive data warehouse of MSK’s EMR information, which contains data on the care of over a million patients since 1989. -->
