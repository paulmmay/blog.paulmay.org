<p class="intro">I have been hacking away at a new website for myself for the last 2 months, and like the builder's house; I'm still not nearly ready to show it off to the outside world. </p>
But, I've decided to go-live with an imperfect site; in the hope that the fiery gaze of public scrutiny will encourage me to get it done and dusted this week. I'm currently in San Francisco attending the Web 2.0 Expo, and should have a little bit of time to make tweaks in the evenings. 

There will be a million things wrong with the site, so if you're visiting and you find dead links, horrible typography, just plain crappiness - know that I am on the case.&nbsp; In the meantime, enjoy the mess.
