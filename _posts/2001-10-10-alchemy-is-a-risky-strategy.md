<p class="intro">This is a brief prelude to a series of articles I'm writing on the ongoing management of web sites and services; some friendly advice on being very honest with yourself or your client when an idea is just, well, bad. </p>
### Ideas are Neither Scarce nor Fragile

A <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/aboutus/toddw.php">very smart man</a> once said that ideas aren't scarce, and aren't fragile. There are millions of ideas out there, I've just had a couple while typing this, and **genuinely good ideas will survive a bit of a pummeling**; a bit of validation at the hands of you know - humans. 

Unfortunately, and all too frequently in my experience,** terrible ideas do indeed persist to the project stage, completely unchallenged**. These are the ideas that should have been changed radically, or binned earlier in the process**. 

We've all been in the scenario where **a client has a budget, a team, and one seriously awful idea**. The project proceeds on the wafer-thin hope that users, data, or charisma will persuade them of all your much better ideas down the road.&nbsp; My advice to you is to **walk away from projects where the client is resolved to try their hand at alchemy** - it just doesn't work. 

At the very least, you should be deeply suspicious where there isn't some kind of idea-validation built into a project from the outset - where a client hasn't allowed room for ideas to be challenged, dropped, developed or improved; or where your team is just plain nervous that this isn't going to work. At the very least, be honest with your client - tell them your concerns. You'll probably be the first person to have raised an eyebrow.

### OMG It's Still Lead

**No amount of post-project hustle, analysis or mumbo-jumbo is going to save you if you are doggedly focused on delivering something that nobody wants. **Your web team won't save you, your content strategist won't save you and Google Analytics won't save you. You'll be hustling/collaborating, writing/editing and measuring/segmenting your way towards the inevitable conclusion that this is a service that humans don't want, and should never have been a project in the first place. 

The flakier among you will turn to some of the flakier techniques to try to &#8220;boost traffic&#8221; but this is just sleight of hand at the magic show. 

### Now What?

So, in my next article on managing sites and services after launch what I'm going to (cheekily) presuppose is that you are starting your project on a solid foundation (common sense):

<ol>
* **You have a good understanding of the people who'll use your services**; you've talked to them, you understand the messy context they live in, you have studied their needs.
* **You've decided what not to do**; you've filtered out (and carefully saved for later) everything that isn't fundamental to the site/service. The core of what you'll do first, why and for whom is clear.
* **You're prepared to have 1. and 2. challenged or improved over time**; especially in the light of new input from the people who'll use your service.
* **You've set a number of objectives** that will help you gauge the success/failure of your idea and prompt course-corrections when necessary.
* **After all is said and done, people are still excited about the idea** and preferably people who don't report to you.
</ol>

This is a <em>gross</em> over-simplification of some of the thought processes that underlie successful projects. From time to time, yes, it's whim - a dream in the face of impossible odds and overwhelming evidence - but very, very rarely. If you'd like the success of your site to be more of a sure thing than a stab in the dark then I highly recommend having this stuff clearly defined, challenged and tested before you spent too much time on your junior alchemist's kit.

Onwards, we'll step forward into the real stuff very soon.
