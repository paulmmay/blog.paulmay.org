<p class="intro">I'll be presenting at BarCamp Belfast. Notionally the topic is: <em>"Everything You Know is Likely to be Wrong - </em>Perspectives on creating value and remaining relevant in the technology industry." Should be fun! I'll post slides, notes and photos here next week.</p>
**Update: **I've <a title="Staying Relevant in Tech Industries - Barcamp Belfast 2008" href="http://paulmay.org/articles/staying-relevant">now uploaded my notes from the talk</a>. it was a good day. The topic I landed on in the end was "<a title="Staying Relevant in Tech Industries - Barcamp Belfast 2008" href="http://paulmay.org/articles/staying-relevant">Staying Relevant in Tech Industries</a>". It was a little abstract, but it was a good first stab at a topic I'd like to develop further.
