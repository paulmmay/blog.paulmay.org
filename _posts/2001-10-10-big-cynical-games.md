A lot of the talk about games makes me queasy. At the moment I am prototyping &#8220;big games&#8221; to be played by many players over an expansive physical space. Yay. As part of this I've had to read, and listen to a lot of folks talking about game design, gamification, and a lot of it is pretty cynical. We make a previously unappealing task &#8220;fun&#8221; and in doing so manipulate people into doing something they would otherwise not want to do. An <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_05/b4213035403146.htm" title="example">example</a>:

<q>Video game designers have spent the last few decades perfecting the art of making their products addictive. Now traditional companies are building loyalty for their websites using so-called gamification techniques. Tactics such as leader boards, which encourage users to compete against one another for points, are becoming common across the Web. &#8220;We're in the middle of an arms race for fun,&#8221; says Gabe Zichermann, an entrepreneur who is organizing the first Gamification Summit.</q>

Or to paraphrase - games seem to be good at making people do stuff, now let's make them do other stuff. 

The article, typical of a lot of stuff I've been reading, goes on to talk about the low cost of virtual rewards like Foursquare badges, the benefits of gamifying loyalty programmes and other creepy weirdness. At no point in time is there any mention of fun, positive outcomes for the user, pleasure. 

There is a difference between a game where** the primary goal is the happiness of the user **through the playing of the game, and one where happiness is one possible outcome among other, more desirable (profitable) outcomes. Nintendo games are fun, that's their point. 

**Loyalty schemes can be made game-like, with possible fun, but the point is to exclude purchasing options you would otherwise have made.**If you have fun but don't exhibit the behaviour we like, you are not playing the game. 

The difference is only subtle if you don't like people very much, and are comfortable with words like &#8220;drive traffic&#8221;.

Hey, guess what, people like slot machines. Thanks capitalism!
