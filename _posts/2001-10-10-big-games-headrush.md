A game for 4-52 people, created in 20 minutes for the Big Games class at ITP. Take a card, stick it on your head and organise into suits without talking or (obvious) gesturing. A lot of fun :) </p>
We're only two weeks into this class; it's already a lot of fun; games are a really pure form of interaction design. We're encouraged to start with something simple, playtest it, improve it, iterate. All good.
