<p class="intro">Never let it be said that I didn't create a processing sketch where a ball bounced around the screen. 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5036503054/" title="Bouncing Balls by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4148/5036503054_158cc6a5ac_z.jpg" class="flickr" alt="Bouncing Balls" /></a></p>
This is a little step forward with objects; in this case each &#8220;ball&#8221; represents an object which is being moved around the screen by a loop. Clicking the mouse anywhere on the screen creates a new ball. Pressing any key on the keyboard &#8220;kills&#8221; the circles currently on the screen (but doesn't actually destroy them). Groundbreaking stuff.

Feel free to <a href="http://paulmay.org/images/uploads/sketch_sep22b_objects_bouncingballs.pde">download the sketch file</a>.

**Update: ** Fixed a few bugs; <a href="http://paulmay.org/images/uploads/sketch_sep29a_bouncing_balls2.pde">new sketch is here.</a> Still by no means clever or finished.
