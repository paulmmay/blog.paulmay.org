<p class="intro">This week we were asked to create sketches featuring iteration and objects; so I've built on the (pointless, but obligatory) bouncing balls sketch to make a brick and ball game.

This is a nowhere-near-finished tribute to all those cool games we played on the C64 when I was a kid. A few notes:


* Collision with the bat/paddle is horrible, unless you hit the top-left corner of the bat you are unlikely to get a collision
* Collision with walls, bricks and the paddle just reverses direction, rather than taking the speed/direction of the ball into account
* Many, many other bugs and shortcomings :)

Having said, all that, I'm happy enough with the game to present it at class this week - and OOP is much fresher in my mind now. I think I will build on this to produce a complete game for my mid-terms. Stay tuned.

Here is <a href="http://paulmay.org/images/uploads/batandball_2.zip">the source of this early version</a>; buyer beware :) If you just want to run the game, here is <a href="http://paulmay.org/images/uploads/sketch_oct1_brickandballgame_2.jar">the jar file</a>.

**Update: **I fixed a few (a very few) bugs. Here is <a href="http://paulmay.org/images/uploads/brickgame4.zip">the new source</a> and <a href="http://paulmay.org/images/uploads/sketch_oct1_brickandballgame_4.jar">jar file</a>.
