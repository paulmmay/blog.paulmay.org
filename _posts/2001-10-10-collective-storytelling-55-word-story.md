<p class="intro">A short story in 55 words, written for my (will I get into the class, won't I get into the class) Collective Storytelling class with Marianne Petit.</p>
### Hotel
&mdash; 	Call me tomorrow, so I know you're still breathin?<br />
she asked.

&mdash; 	You call me, I like the attention - besides, i don't have your number<br />
he smiled

&mdash; 	Guy like you, girl like me; it doesn't end well â€“ never does

&mdash; 	Maybe&#8230;maybe.&nbsp; But maybe we're different?

She sighed, wrote the number, then closed the door; already regretting.
