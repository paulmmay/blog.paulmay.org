<p class="intro">This week in Collective Storytelling we were asked to make a short piece of audio that tells a story in three parts. Mine is called Swimming.****</p>

### Notes
<p class="update">**Update: **I presented <em>Swimming</em> to my class yesterday and got some great feedback. People were very positive about the quality of the audio, the use of sound - but thought that the water/wave sounds were overused (especially when people were talking about swimming in a pool) and sounded too ominous (the speakers in the room were very bass-y, which didn't help). I tend to agree with this feedback, but I don't think I'll re-cut the piece - I'll just learn from it, apply it to my next piece. As usual the feedback from my ITP classmates was insightful and spot-on.

Like a lot of people, I think **swimming is one of my first memories;** being brought to the local pool by my Mum, taking lessons. I stopped swimming when I got a bit older, but happily rediscovered it  when I was asked to give triathlons a try. It's played a pretty big part in my life in the last 5 years. In my audio story I wanted to **explore how people feel about swimming, the role it plays in their lives and how it makes them feel**.

Aside from being interested in swimming as an activity - it's also sonically rich; when I swim I'm **conscious of the sound of the water, the sounds of other swimmers**, the thoughts in my head - so I thought it'd make a good subject for an audio story.

### Structure
The piece is broken in three parts; a short opening section about **a first experience of swimming**, a longer section in the middle describing **the physical and mental experience of swimming** in a pool and in the sea, and then a short closing section about **the way swimming makes you feel** after you've done it. 

I wanted the piece to have **a defined beginning, middle and end** - so each of the interviewees was given the same instructions and asked the same set of questions in the same order. Even still, the structure of the piece wasn't really clear in my head until I started editing it all together.

The** water sounds****** were recorded on the beach at Coney Island, New York - where it was bloody freezing. Other effects are just standard MIDI percussion instruments. 

### Thanks
Thank you so much to Saraswathi Subbaraman, Will Jennings and Eszter Ozsvald who were kind enough to talk to me for the piece; they are nice people. Eszter's interview isn't featured in the final piece; the symmetry between Saraswathi and Will's voices (one male, one female) just worked well so I stuck with that.
