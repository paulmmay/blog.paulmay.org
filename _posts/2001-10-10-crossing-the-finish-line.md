I made it. On Sunday I successfully completed the Chicago Triathlon in a time of <a href="http://triathlons.accenture.com/Chicago/tracking/Map.aspx?bib=3345" target="_parent">2 hours 53 minutes and 47 seconds</a>. It hasn't really sunk in yet; to have finished is great, but I'm very proud that I made it in under three hours.

We'll be back in Dublin in a couple of days, and then I'll write a full race report and post photos. Thanks for all your support in the last four months, I really appreciate it. I made it, I made it, I made it! (I'm very happy)
