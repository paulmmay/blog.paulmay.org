<p class="intro">I have under 4 weeks to design and build a final project for my Intro to Physical Computing class, but I am struggling to pin down an idea. I am stumped. In a quandry. A pickle. </p>
<q>Final project. Create a physically interactive system of your choice. Your focus in this assignment should be on careful and timely sensing of the relevant actions of the person or people that you're designing this for, and on clear, prompt, and effective response. Any interactive system is going to involve systems of listening, thinking, and speaking from both parties. Whether it involves one cycle or many, the exchange should be engaging</q>

I am floundering a bit because (for once) I'd** like to make something that is not a direct response to a problem**; problem solving is a lot of fun, and it's what I'm good at - but I feel as though this is an opportunity to imagine things that I'd like to see in the world. That's not to say it can't be useful, or practical.

I am also a little **keen not to build a watered-down version of existing physically interactive systems**; it might be fun for me to try to build/mimic the behaviour of a Wii or the Kinect, but is there much point? I think it's important to interpret the brief in the context we live in today - where physically interactive systems are commonplace.

I have had lots and lots of ideas, and i explored three that excited me in some detail - but on reflection they didn't offer an immediate experience to the user - they were systems that captured information in a physical setting, for use and analysis later. This is still interesting to me, but not classically interactive - I suppose.

I would love to hear your thoughts on physical, human computer interaction - and what areas would be interesting to explore. What should I make?
