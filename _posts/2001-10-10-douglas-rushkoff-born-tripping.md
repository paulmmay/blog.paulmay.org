<blockquote>When you're born tripping, you don't know you're tripping. The possibility of a more considered engagement with media is worth pursuing.
</blockquote>

Doug Rushkoff came to speak to us about his book <em>Program or be Programmed</em>. I don't agree entirely that absolutely everybody needs to know how to program in order to engage with new media, but I take his point - that a basic understanding of the tools and processes used in the construction of media is very useful. 

Rushkoff's talk made me want to read <em>Amusing Ourselves to Death</em> again - no bad thing.
