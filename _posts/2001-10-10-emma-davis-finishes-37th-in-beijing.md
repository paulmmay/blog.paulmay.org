<p class="intro">Set your alarm clocks now! At 3am Irish time tomorrow, <a href="http://www.rte.ie/sport/2008/0609/davise.html">Emma Davis</a> will become Ireland's first Olympic Triathlete as she competes in the Beijing 2008 games. </p>
### Before
The race is taking place at the Ming Tomb Reservoir&#8230;great name. We <a href="http://www.hipsternascar.com/2008/08/day-1-of-track-racing-at-olympics.html">haven't been so lucky on the track</a> or in the pool so far, so let's hope Emma does herself proud and kicks some ass.

If you've haven't managed to catch an Olympic triathlon on TV before make sure you check it out; it is incredibly exciting to watch!  I am flying to the UK for work tonight, so I will probably not get to see the race&#8230;.if any kind soul out there wants to DivX the race and make it available through some sort of filesharing application, that would be sweet.
