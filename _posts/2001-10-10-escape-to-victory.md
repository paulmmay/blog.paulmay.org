<p class="intro">Today was my last day in my current job with Accenture. I got up a bit later than usual before getting the Dart into the head office - where I handed in my laptop and name badge, did the exit interview, and headed off into the wild blue yonder.</p>
It's been an interesting couple of years. I've met some great people and worked on some interesting projects. I've traveled a bit, trained with people from all over the world, and taken up Triathlon. Working with a large (huge) multinational really opens your eyes; you see the scale that a company can grow to, the scale of the money that washes around the global economy, and the "machinery" companies put in place to stay big and get bigger.

On the negative side, I never felt as though the work I was doing was a good fit for my skills or interests. That's not to say that I didn't learn things, but that my job sometimes felt like a bit of a detour - and some days I found it hard to motivate myself; which is hard for somebody who considers himself to be pretty driven.

Before the money gets better, before I get a little bit older I'll take a leap and hope that my next job (which I'll talk about in coming days) is a much better fit. Belfast here we come.
