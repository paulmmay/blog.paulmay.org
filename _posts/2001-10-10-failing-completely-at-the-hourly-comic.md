<p class="intro"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5429503247/" title="You're the Big Dog by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5094/5429503247_859b5e23f7_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="You're the Big Dog" /></a>Today I was *supposed* to draw a comic each hour I was awake based on the previous hour. I failed - pretty comprehensively.</p>
### Harder Than You'd Think
As part of my Collective Storytelling class we were asked to perform the <a href="http://www.hourlycomic.com/" title="Hourly Comic">Hourly Comic</a>; turning each hour of one day into a comic. My day got off to a poor start when **I forgot to draw between the hours of 9am and 12pm while I was in work**. 

There was **a brief sprint of energy **at 12 when I tried to remember anything vaguely noteworthy that had happened in work today (a deadline, a few conversations with my boss and some overheard office banter) and cheated by drawing a couple of these incidents as comics. I kept up with the hourly format between 12 and 3pm. Between 3pm and 6pm I was in a class, and didn't draw a comic. I've just done the final comic of my day to make a pathetic total of 7 comics - cobbled together through various means, both fair and foul.

### What I Learned
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5429503145/" title="Tag Already Invented by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5015/5429503145_4df00573b9_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="Tag Already Invented" /></a><br />
The hourly comic is hard; or at least it was for me. Getting into a rhythm of observing, making notes, then turning notes into a little product each hour is easier said than done. 

Listening to, or participating in, conversations becomes a **comic-fodder-hunt;** which is a little cynical perhaps. On the positive side, I noticed myself observing my surroundings more carefully and listening to what my friends say in more detail. 

Like last weeks <a href="http://paulmay.org/blog/collective-storytelling-6-word-story/" title="6">6</a> and <a href="http://paulmay.org/blog/collective-storytelling-55-word-story/" title="55 word">55 word</a> pieces, the constraints of the three panel comic is actually quite refreshing; you have to choose your words carefully. 

Now; let's never speak of this again. <br />
