<p class="intro">This week we were asked to design a device with a physical interface that doesn't exist, but that could exist in the future. Mine is called Magic Mirror.

Magic Mirror allows its users to meet and interact with an almost life-like version of any human from the present or past. Magic Mirror is a tangible interface to the conversations you wish you could have, but can't.

### Magic Mirror - How Does it Work?

Magic Mirror starts by asking a simple question - **<i>Who would you like to talk to today?</i>** Just answer, and Magic Mirror will get to work.

Magic Mirror starts by **building your desired subject's personality and modes of interaction**. It does this by finding and aggregating the extensive body of information about the subject's likes, dislikes, habits and routines available in public and private databases. It then analyses the subject's use of language; his or her writings, conversations, discussions and interactions - in text, audio and video formats. The information gathered is processed using Magic Mirror's proprietary technology - the result is a highly accurate simulation of the subject's personality and style of communication, enabling life-like interaction.<br />

Magic Mirror then draws on photographs and videos taken of the subject to build a **startlingly accurate, three-dimensional model of the subject's physicality, clothing, surroundings and posessions**.

Finally, Magic Mirror does what no other system can; **it augments gathered information with your own stories, memories and objects**. Talk to Magic Mirror about the subject in your own words; tell stories, show photographs or videos. **Just relax and reminisce** and let Magic Mirror integrate this new information into its model of the subject.

### Magic Mirror - Interface

Within minutes, Magic Mirror will have finished processing all data - **just step forward to meet the subject**. You'll be able to interact with the subject through our patented, high-fidelity multitouch surface. Sensitive microphones will pick up and process your every word. Targeted audio processing will make the words your subject says sound like any other day-to-day conversation. **Have the conversations you've always wanted to have; Magic Mirror offers an experience you will never forget. **

### Concept

The basic idea for Magic Mirror was to design something that offered the experience of <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/paul.m.may" title="a social aggregator">a social aggregator</a>, stretched to a fantastic (and somewhat creepy) conclusion. 

Obviously, Magic Mirror doesn't exist; but **the basic building blocks of it do**. Many of us share a large amount of information about ourselves online; Magic Mirror exists in a time when the definitions of private and public are radically different from what they are today - with extensive libraries of data available about anybody who has lived and used connected technologies. 

Private** databases exist today - documenting the things we like, and don't like** - the items we buy at the supermarket, the television we watch and many other aspects of our daily lives. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that we might voluntarily choose to give access to these databases **in return for some sort of enhanced experience, or payment of some kind**. 

We form thoughts in our minds in the way we form sentences on a screen or page, so **it's possible that with enough information a sort of model of our interactions with others could be constructed**. 

All of this data could then be **used as the basis of rich, interactive simulations**.&nbsp; 

The physical interface is something that could be built today - and I was interested in the idea that **a really compelling interface, offering us access to a richer, more emotional experience would be a powerful tool in helping to smooth over any imperfections**. 

I also wonder what types of choices we will make in the future when **experiences available to us do more than solve problems and meet immediate needs - and instead touch our deeply-felt desires**. If Magic Mirror was available, even with imperfections, how far would we go to improve the quality of the experience - how many stories would we tell, how much data would we offer? My guess is we would offer quite a bit of ourselves.

So, in conclusion - Magic Mirror was conceived to generate discussion about these types of issues - if only in my own head; and I think it has done that. Building and photographing the model was also a lot of fun. I hope you found it interesting.
