<p class="intro">We're on the downhill slope to Chicago now, with a little under two months to go until the race. I'll be ramping up my training from this week, with one more sprint triathlon in a few weeks to prepare for.</p>
While I'll still be writing about training, the focus of the website will move towards encouraging you to sponsor me for the triathlon. The option of sponsoring me through PayPal is quick and easy, all you need is a credit card. I'll have a dedicated bank account set up by the end of this week, which you can lodge money into. There'll also be some fundraising events taking place between now and the end of August.

So, a lot to do! Thanks for all the support to date.
