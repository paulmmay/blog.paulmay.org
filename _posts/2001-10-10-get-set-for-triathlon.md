<p class="intro">The nerves are jangling - only two days away from the Blackrock Sprint Triathlon. I'm resting up in advance of the race, so no swimming tomorrow. I had a physio session last night, again focusing on my left side and a twinge in my left shoulder I picked up at swimming on Tuesday. </p>
All in all I think I'm ready for Saturday, but I'd be surprised if I run the whole 5K - the priority needs to be getting experience of being in a race, swimming in a group, but not killing myself in the process to prove a point.

Anyway, I'll write an update before and after the race. I hope you're all well.
