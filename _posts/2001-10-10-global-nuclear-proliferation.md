Global Nuclear Proliferation was a 5 day long augmented reality game created for the Big Games class at ITP. Four players race to aid/stop an international conspiracy to smuggle a package of dangerous nuclear secrets. </p>
### Concept

The original concept was to **create an augmented reality game based on the structure of a 419 e-mail scam**; we liked the idea of using &#8220;real life&#8221; events, then blending them with a written narrative. 

Over several iterations of the story we hit on the idea of using e-mail scam as an introduction for one character in a wider story; drawing an unwitting patsy in an attempt by a criminal gang to sell nuclear secrets which originated in the lab of (real life) nuclear proliferator A.Q. Khan. We liked this because it gave us a rich, fantastic backstory to work with, good guys and bad guys and a compelling target/goal for both teams to aim for.

### Characters/Players
The game was played by 4 characters; essentially broken down into 2 teams - conspirators helping to smuggle nuclear secrets, government agents trying to stop this from happening. The characters were:

**The Patsy** - a dupe, drawn into the story through their own misfortune. The patsy is told they have won a prize, they just need to do a simple task before collecting their prize. Each time they do something - there’s just a little bit more demanded of them. This character was played by Michael Cohen.

**The Exit Man** - a buyer and mover of illicit items. The exit man will act as a contact for the patsy, and just wants to get the item so he can collect his reward. This character was played by Nara Kasbergen.

**Operative** - a low-level undercover agent tasked with gathering information, shadowing the Patsy. This character was played by Spike McCue.

**The Handler** - a senior agent who is given the full backstory of the plot, controls the actions of the operative and serves as the key decision maker for the &#8220;good guys&#8221;. This character was played by Eric Hagan.

In addition to the player characters there were two non-player characters; a Contact for the Sudanese criminal organisation directing the actions of the Exit Man and the Patsy, and a Senior Agent working for a government agency directing the actions of the Handler and the Operative. These characters were played by me and my super-talented classmate Natalie Be'er.

### Back Story (Some Reality, Sprinkled with Fiction)

No single individual has done more to aid the spread of nuclear weapons than A.Q. Khan.

Khan was born in Pakistan in 1936 and received degrees in physics, mathematics and metallurgy. Khan’s 1972 doctoral thesis proposed several key improvements to the design of gas centrifuges; they key equipment involved in the enrichment of weapons’ grade uranium. Khan went on to hold key positions at engineering companies in Europe where he worked almost exclusively on the design of uranium enrichment systems.

It is now known that while working in Europe through the 1970s and early 1980s Khan made illicit copies of practically every document, drawing and computer file related to the production of highly enriched uranium. He developed relationships with a network of manufacturers and engineering companies around the world with whom he shared these documents; in essence creating a supply chain able to deliver nuclear weapons technology on demand. He worked closely with nuclear scientists in his native Pakistan to develop that country’s first viable nuclear weapon - the existence of which remained a secret until the mid 1980s. In 2003, under growing international pressure, Khan was questioned about the sale of nuclear technology. He confessed to having supplied designs to Libya, Iran and North Korea.

On his arrest, several tonnes of documents and drawings were seized from Khan’s lab - as well as 12 computers, dozens of external computer hard drives and prototype centrifuge parts. When a thorough inventory of these materials was produced an interesting pattern was spotted; key steps in the process of producing a viable nuclear weapon were completely missing. We believe that Khan managed to evacuate these documents several weeks in advance of the raid.

For 6 years we have had no credible intelligence as to the whereabouts of these documents; until now. Once of our sources has indicated that a Sudanese businessman Mr. Aziz Taha, acting on information from inside the Khan network, has located, or is close to locating these materials.

Little is known about Mr. Taha. He was certainly born in the Sudan in or around 1950. He was educated privately, and by the time he was in his early 20s had assumed a role at Sudan’s largest zinc extraction company. In 1985 his name appears in transcripts from a corruption trial involving the Sudanese energy minister; one witness describes Taha as a “talented man [...] able to solve import/export problems involving [...] known for his temper”. The government minister was subsequently acquitted following the disappearance of key witnesses. The man who mentioned Taha’s name was later found dead. This is the last official mention of Taha in any Sudanese record.

Taha became a subject of interest for international law enforcement agencies in 1993 when a forged shipping manifest linked one of his companies registered in Angola to a Soviet arms dealer Victor Anatolyevich Bout. It is probable that Taha was acting as a fixer for the illegal export of rare metals from Angola - using Bout as a courier. Another possible scenario is that Taha was acting as a local contact for an armed group being supplied with weapons by Bout. It may be that a two-way exchange of metals and weapons was involved - we simply do not know. There was insufficient evidence to arrest, or even detain Mr. Taha and he quickly disappeared.

We do not need to tell you how important it is that the Khan materials not fall into Taha’s hands; it is highly likely that he would quickly move to copy and sell them, or use them as leverage is some larger scheme.

Your job this week is to stop Taha from obtaining the Khan materials. 

### Game Play
The game played out over 5 days following a day by day playbook written by myself and Natalie. The playbook broke down the key plot points for the different characters, interventions that would need to be made by the non-player characters and any tools/props/materials we'd need to create.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5570196784/" title="Day by Day Playbook"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5264/5570196784_ed86f7ea67_b.jpg" class="photo" alt="Day by Day Playbook" /></a>

Over the course of the week, several chapters didn't go to plan or to schedule - so we essentially had to tweak the storyline in response to the actions of the characters; this was a lot of work, but also a lot of fun. For example, the Patsy didn't pick up a set of customs documents in time forcing the Sudanese gang contact to reveal the true nature of the scheme - implicating the Patsy, drawing him closer into the plot.

The **closing scenes of the game **were initially supposed to involve a mobile phone hidden in the Strand bookstore, but we chose instead to introduce an encrypted message to all the characters, which if broken would lead them to grand central station in New York where the nuclear secrets were to be delivered; the decrypted message directed them to a train where we waited with a package (a small prize). 

One team managed to crack half of the message, but our story finished with the nuclear secrets remaining on the train, returning to their destination; (maybe to re-appear at some point in the future). Just another package on a train.

Using the micro-film archives available at NYU **we took real articles from the New York times which chronicled the development of A.Q. Khan's proliferation network** over 25 years. These were used to tell the back-story of our game to the characters. We then wrote and added layers of fictional details on top of these real events (the Sudanese gang etc.)

We used two **Gmail and Google Voice accounts** to communicate with both sides of the conspiracy over the course of the week; we could send emails and text messages to move the play along, change the story, give feedback/encouragement, pass on new information. We bought **a cheap mobile phone** for use in one of the chapters; but this section was (sadly) written out when play went in a different direction.

We tried to **make the touch-points as real as possible**; for example, in the chapter where the Patsy was supposed to fill in customs documents, we used real (though slightly modified) US customs documents. 

### Lessons Learned
The key things I learned were:


* It's possible to **write a compelling game that blends fact and fiction, real-life and technology** - people are willing to suspend disbelief if the action is compelling enough.
* Blending real events/themes with fictional events gives you a really rich palette of material to draw from.
* A day by day playbook is a very good idea, but **you have to allow flexibility - when things don't go to plan, you have to have a fallback that doesn't involve stopping the game/breaking character.**
* With a small number of players and a reasonably simple story **it's possible to write for these contingencies on the fly**; in fact this might even be better.
* People **do not have a huge amount of time to play a game** like this; they *might* go out of their way to travel great distances, overcome serious friction - but it's also possible to mix up their daily routine just a little bit, ask them to do simple things to add depth; you don't need to send them to faraway fields to dig up treasure for it to be fun.
* There is **so much technology at your disposal to tell stories like this**; the use of Gmail and Google voice really helped us to bring the game directly to the players.
* With more time you could craft communications tools, materials, props, non-player character identities really carefully; there's probably no limit to the level of detail you could bring to a game like this.
* Writing and managing a game like this is **a huge amount of work - and just as much fun!**


All in all I hugely enjoyed designing, writing and executing this game - I'll take the lessons I learned into my next projects.
