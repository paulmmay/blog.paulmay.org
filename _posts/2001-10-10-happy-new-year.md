<p class="intro">I'm all in for Alcatraz; god help me. 8th of June I'll be jumping off a boat off into the Pacific for a leisurely swim from the famous island to San Francisco followed by a bit of a cycle and a run. Grand stuff.</p>
Back in the real world we spent New Year's Eve in the company of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/richiejape" target="_parent">Jape</a> and friends at Whelans. Cracking gig and a fun night. I'm back in work today. Yay. Photos of Christmas exploits are on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay">Flickr</a>.
