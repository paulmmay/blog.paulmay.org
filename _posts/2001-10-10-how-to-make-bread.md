<p class="intro">Each week at our Applications class we hear from a guest speaker, and a group of students respond to the speaker from the previous week. We heard from, then reacted to Doug Rushkoff's talk about his new book, Program or be Programmed.

### The Talk
Rushkoff's main point was that at a time when so much of our lives are influenced by, and mediated by digital technology it's important to foster a sense of curiosity, exploration, questioning and understanding of digital systems. Simplistically, **we need to understand the biases, traits and construction of tools like social networks so that we can make good decisions** and maintain independence of thought and action - basically so we don't get lead up the garden path by marketers and evil-doers. The other main point that I took away from his talk was his **advocacy for a peer-to-peer system of value** tied to effort, not arbitrary financial values - which as we've seen are built on somewhat flimsy ground.

### Reaction
The group - me, Fernanda Bak, Noah Crowley, Cyrus Von Hochstetter and Yoonjo Shin - all lovely people - talked extensively about Rushkoff's ideas. To be honest, **we didn't feel that he was saying anything massively novel** - it was common sense to us that **people should understand as much of the world they live in as possible**, but that people's interests would obviously dictate what parts of the world they seek to understand.

We didn't really need to prove that **the system of currency and finance that has been created up until now is open for abuse and manipulation** - other people have made that point eminently on our behalf.

### Implementation &amp; Presentation

We decided to demonstrate a simple skill, how to make bread, as **an example of the value of understanding a system/the world around us** and the **exchange of a skill/value between people**. 

We would also create **an opportunity and a system for people in our class, who otherwise might not know that their peers have particular skills, to talk and share simple skills.** In essence, we wanted our presentation to **roll the two main points of his talk** and show how achievable (and in a sense normal/common-sensible) they are.

We got together at my house, and I showed the group **how to make a simple yeast bread**. We filmed the process, and talked about how it related to the talk. We then designed a card-trading mechanic for the class, and set up a simple shared spreadsheet where skills could be offered or requested.

On the day of our presentation **we showed our short film to the rest of the class - which got a good reaction**. We handed out **cards for people to write down their skill to exchange with others** and gave a simple demo of what we wanted people to do. <br />

As a final piece of the presentation we** asked everybody to go to a shared spreadsheet to document skills that they could offer others, and what they themselves wanted to learn** - creating a resource of 140 skills on offer or in demand. 

So, that's it - it was a very busy week between Rushkoff's talk and the presentation, but I'm proud of the results.
