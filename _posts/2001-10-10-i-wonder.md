<p class="intro">I wonder if all camp sites in Germany have olympic size swimming pools. This one does anyway (and a full size astro pitch). </p>
We were out on the town until about 6 so I only did a warm up to clear the head this morning; 600m at a snail's pace. Maybe tomorrow I'll do a full session, but that'll depend on the post-match atmosphere in town later. Ol&#233; Ol&#233; from Berlin.
