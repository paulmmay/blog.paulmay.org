<p class="intro">There's a place I go back to again and again in my head, even in my dreams; Inis O&iacute;rr. I haven't been there in 20 years, but I'll go back some day.</p>

Some of my friends have the immense good fortune to be heading off to the annual <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30602805@N08/sets/72157610849180805/">currach races</a> on Inis O&iacute;rr this weekend. It's just a magical place; **barely more than a scrap of rock in the Atlantic, but so completely unique in every way **- the people, the language, the landscape. 

I spent three weeks there when I was <em>12</em> and to this day I think about it. We watched one of the island men make a willow basket, we walked to the lighthouse, visited the wreck of the Plassey, danced at the c&eacute;il&iacute;, stayed with a nice (if a little odd) family, and got to grips with our Irish vocabulary. We learned about how the islanders had literally made the soil on the island out of seaweed carried from the beaches.&nbsp; It was just **an amazing place to spend some time if you were a child from a city**. <br />

I'm sure there's a huge difference between what I remember and what actually exists now (is there?), but there's no harm in that I suppose. **I'd love to go back, I will go back - soon enough**. Have a ball Ciarj and all who are making the trip this weekend.
