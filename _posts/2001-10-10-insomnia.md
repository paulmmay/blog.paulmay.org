<p class="intro">Accenture-induced insomnia abounds.</p>
I haven't slept properly in about 10 nights. Between the mild anxiety of starting a new job, and the over-tiredness which goes with the training and the nights out here, my body clock just seems to have gone a bit awry. Let's hope tonight will be a little bit different. I'm tired. Update: Slept like a log :)
