<p class="intro">I'm in Berlin putting in some serious "training" hours&#8230;not really. I've taken the weekend off to come and visit the World Cup in Berlin. </p>
We may not actually be playing this time around, but the atmosphere is still great. Later on we're off to the FanFest in the middle of the city; a massive, mile-long, all singing, all dancing, big-screen, beer and food festival for all the people not lucky enough to have tickets for the matches (now going for many multiples of their face value).

Anyway, I'm going to dash. I'll try to get a swim in one of the local schwimmbad's today or tomorrow. Don't be too hard on me if I don't though. All the best.
