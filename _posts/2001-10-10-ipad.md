<p class="intro">I am underwhelmed by some things (ebooks, web-browsing, operating system) and impressed by others (a genuinely capable mobile device, a multitouch screen that's useful and fun). But, what I find more interesting is the apparent set of choices and values that seem to underpin Apple as a company, and the iPad's design by extension. </p>

### Consumption
What is pretty clear to me, despite the demonstration of the iPad as an artist's canvas, is that this is a device which is geared towards **reasonably passive consumption of products and services**. 

Looking at **photos** on the iPad seems to be a gorgeous experience, but getting them onto the device is still no better than syncing to iTunes or transferring them from your camera; the experience you can already get with an iPod or iPhone. I can also watch high quality video, but there's **no camera** to turn that idea around - putting me into a still image or video on somebody else's iPad. This seems to me like a missed opportunity for really **interesting inter-personal engagement** on a tactile, mobile device. 

**Multitouch interfaces** are great for rotating, swiping, scrolling, sorting, moving, picking, placing - but not so hot at fine control of say, a keyboard. I can't help but think that there's a fundamental value to the physicality of a keyboard that you can't replicate on a smooth surface, though Apple have made good progress with the iPhone, and no doubt learned a lot. 

The **operating system**, like the iPhone, isn't too friendly towards me finding my own software to install and use unless I do it through the iTunes Store. This obviously makes sense for Apple from a business perspective, but it is limiting.

### Balance
So, when I look at the capabilities of the iPad I can't help but think that the **balance** between me being able to **create artefacts, capture myself and document my surroundings** is out of kilter with my ability to **manipulate and consume things I create or buy elsewhere**. On a phone I think this is okay but when you get into a larger, more expensive, more capable machine this looks more like a business choice rather than a design constraint. I'm not saying Apple are a million miles away, but it all just feels a bit overbearing.

### Personality
No company goes to greater lengths to **limit access to its internal thought processes and to choreograph its public persona** - Apple have both of these competencies down to a fine art. Control seems to be at the heart of their company culture; **control of ideas, secrets and perceptions**. 

I just find it really interesting that** this personality seems to come across so strongly in the design of its newer products and services;** from the minimalist industrial design of the iPad to the capabilities it grants its users on its operating system and the business model at the core of the ever-expanding iTunes Store. 

You could look on this as being negative and dictatorial, or you could give Apple credit for really and truly **living their personality in everything they do**. In any case, it's no harm to have a rummage through the thoughts that seem to underlie what is likely to become an important product. 

Apple, you scary amazing clever bastards.
