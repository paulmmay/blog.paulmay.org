<p class="intro">Why is Irish data so hard to find? I'm not sure, but as a country Ireland has an opportunity to create a new landscape for information sharing and press freedom. You know, so we don't end up in the shit again.</p>

I've started working on <a href="http://paulmay.org/itp/what-happened" title="what happened - paul may">a project</a> to **aggregate and visualise data relating to Ireland from 1980-2010**. Finding this data has been difficult. Putting the data into formats I can use efficiently is going to be painful. It turns out, unsurprisingly, that most data I was trying to find about Irish public life in the last 30 years either isn't available, or isn't available in formats that make it easy to analyse. For example:


* The <a href="http://www.finance.gov.ie" title="Department of Finance">Department of Finance</a>&#8216;s reports on key economic indicators (<a href="http://www.finance.gov.ie/ViewDoc.asp?DocId=-1&amp;CatID=2" title="monthly bulletins">monthly bulletins</a>, tax receipt reports, expenditure reports etc.) are only published as PDFs on their website.
* The <a href="http://www.cso.ie" title="Central Statistics Office">Central Statistics Office</a> - the body responsible for information collection and dissemination - makes data available in flat files (csv, excel, px etc.) or HTML tables, but these have to be requested through their website. No <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" title="API">API</a> or other machine-friendly access/format is available.
* <a href="http://www.rte.ie" title="RT&Eacute;">RT&Eacute;</a> offer access to their <a href="http://www.rte.ie/laweb/" title="photographic archive">photographic archive</a> online but images are watermarked heavily. No machine access is available, and no other RT&Eacute; archive material is available online.


Private media companies are obviously under no obligation to share their data in accessible formats, but it would be nice. The Irish Times and Irish Independent's archives are pretty woeful; light-years behind what is being done by The New York Time, Guardian, NPR, Current, BBC and other media organisations.

### Information Fuels Democracy

This might sound like an engineering problem, but I think it's **much more fundamental than that**. When the world was run by slower, linear, paper-based decision making processes it was perfectly reasonable to create and maintain records in silos, send them around at a leisurely pace, and then make them available when and if they were needed - or not - because who do you think you are? 

We don't live in this world, and you could argue that we haven't lived there for a long time - and it's pretty clear that **they way the Irish government, public bodies and media organisations share information hasn't kept pace with reality**. Having a website is seen as doing enough. 

Good democracy requires that we are able to hold public government, and those who exercise power to account. **The friction involved in getting the most basic information from Irish public institutions acts against informed democracy**. We assume that getting insight into how the government spends money is impossible, so we don't try. It's a feedback loop that encourages secrecy, let's bad people away with doing bad things, keeps good people from getting the credit they deserve - and promotes a lack of understanding of how difficult it actually is to run a country.

We are living through a bruising period in Irish history - and the next government doesn't just need to take painful economic decisions, it also need to begin to **restore trust in the idea that government works in all our interests**. We have an information problem.

### We Are Not Alone
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/8058853@N06/4823859060/" title="Roads in Iceland by visiticeland on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4823859060_c3d819d4b8_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="Roads in Iceland" /></a><br />
Soon after its own decline into economic chaos, Iceland (above - doesn't it look lovely?) realised it also had an information problem - there were just too many places for bad decisions to hide, so their parliament <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/17/iceland-passes-world%27s-strongest-press-freedom-laws" title="passed strong press freedom laws ">passed strong press freedom laws </a>that would enable difficult questions to be asked in the future. It's embarrassing that in Ireland we are still bringing journalists to court to force them to reveal their sources. (I am not saying the economic meltdown could have been avoided if Irish financial journalists had tools to get at more information - they were asleep at the wheel - but it would be a start, and would give them no excuses.)

The US government required that raw data on fiscal stimulus spending be made available in both human and <a href="http://gcn.com/Articles/2009/04/29/Kundra-talks-data-gov.aspx" title="machine-readable formats">machine-readable formats</a>. They also created <a href="http://data.gov" title="Data.gov">Data.gov</a> - a central source for federal data.&nbsp; We have PDFs.

Both the Icelandic and US governments recognised that a free exchange of timely information has a role in avoiding crises in the future, and is required for real democracy. What do we have to do to get on board with, you know, the present?

### Let's Do Something

One of the first things the next government should do is to **require all government departments to make all substantive data collected or created in the course of their work available in machine-readable file formats, and also through a freely available <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" title="API">API</a>**. This information should be gathered together in one place where people can access it on their own terms, and should be extended out to all bodies who receive public money over a certain threshold within a short period of time. If citizens are paying for the clock, citizens should be able to see the clockwork.

The government should also prove that it is a supporter of active inquiry into how it works - and should **put in place strong protection for whistle-blowers**, **emulate Iceland's new press freedom laws**, **remove the fee for freedom of information requests**. Make it clear that Ireland has changed, changed utterly.

### Don't Make This a Complicated Project

**First of all don't make this a project. **This isn't a project - a temporary get-together to create instantly obsolete artifacts - this is **a set of new understandings**. The wrong way to do this would be to hire a massive, international consultancy firm to carry out an epic, exhausting, expensive project - whereby they would first identify every piece of data that bodies have, engineer new processes to make all that data easier to collect, procure servers, put teams of programmers to work etc. etc. We've tried that, and it sucks. Really. Please don't do this. 

First, just **agree - in one sentence - what expectations Irish people should have of their government in relation to information**; a sort of Data Elevator Pitch. Match the need for information in an active democracy with a set of principles that should apply across Government. 

Next, carry out **a one week consultation to identify the 10 points of data that would be useful for other parts of government, experts (researchers, media), and members of the public**. Shocking stuff I know - ask people what they want.

For each of these data points **define how it's created, by whom and how often.** If it isn't currently created, or isn't available, flag this publicly - and move on to the next data point. This isn't a project remember, so you can think longer term - so long as you actually come back and get that data point very, very soon.

Now, just **get the bloody data and stick it in a database; none of this million Euro consultancy shite - cheap or free tools on bulletproof servers**. Take everything currently in the CSO's databases and make sense of that too. Write a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" title="API">API</a> that returns a particular data point for a particular time period - get to the release of a minimal viable product within 4 weeks of the end of your consultation period. Yes! 4 weeks! Holy real-world-timeframes!

Gather feedback from the people who use these tools constantly - make your users the most important people in your world - and create a roadmap for 1, 3, 6 months. Release improvements every two weeks and keep moving your roadmaps forward.

### But Who Will Do This?

**This doesn't have to be like pulling teeth;** it is the type of project that could use one or two helpful (non-gold-digging) advisors, and a merry band of 3-5 folks (youngsters) in each department. They just have to very good with technology, very good with people, humble enough to think small, and have - and I'm not joking here - 100% support from internal masters and the government. Just let them do it, keep the shit out of their way.

### We Will Thank You For This/Elect Your Opposition

If you **create this new reality**, build the tools, give us the information we need in a timely fashion, don't charge us for the &#8220;privilege&#8221; <em>and</em> make the project look straightforward you will have succeeded in doing what **no other government has ever done**. If you make it easy to get at data, and we see how limited your choices are, **we will understand when you make sensible decisions which turn out not to bear fruit**. At least you will have made it easy for us to see the context in which you're operating.

And if you don't take this opportunity; well, we will continue to have little useful insight into how decisions are made. When things don't turn out for the best **we will assume you are secretive and/or incompetent and we will elect the other people**. Soon the time to act will have passed, the inertia will overcome you, and we citizens will put our hopes away for whomever is next - because, of course, this is all Ireland could ever have been.
