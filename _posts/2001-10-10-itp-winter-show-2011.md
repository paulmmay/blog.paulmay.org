<p class="intro">I have three projects in this year's ITP Winter Show; <em>MetroChange</em> - a charitable donation system that uses New York subway cards, <em>Pilot</em> - a wearable device that helps people swim more efficiently and <em>Forever</em> - an immersive experience for one person. </p>
### MetroChange

For more information about MetroChange see <a href="http://www.metrochange.org" title="http://www.metrochange.org">metrochange.org</a>. There is a lot of good documentation and background information on the <a href="http://blog.metrochange.org" title="MetroChange blog">MetroChange blog</a>. MetroChange is a collaboration with Stepan Boltalin and <a href="http://www.genevievehoffman.com/portfolio.html" title="Genevieve Hoffman">Genevieve Hoffman</a>.

Pilot is a speculative system at the moment; I have been told by many, many swimmers that this is a device that has real potential. I have a clear sense of what it would take to make this into a real device, something I'm going to attempt to make happen in the next 6 months. I will keep you posted. 

### Forever

Designed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Society_of_the_Spectacle" title="a critique of The Spectacle">a critique of The Spectacle</a> with the desire to avoid using the media of spectacle, Forever offers an isolating, immersive, indescribable experience for one person. The project is a collaboration with the amazing <a href="http://lilyszajnberg.com/" title="Lily Szajnberg">Lily Szajnberg</a> and came out of the Recurring Concepts in Art class at ITP (one of the best classes I have ever taken).&nbsp; 

### Winter Show
I'll be writing more about these three projects in the days to come, but I'm proud of all of them. Please come and see me at the ITP Winter Show. Find me or tweet <a href="http://twitter.com/paulmmay" title="@paulmmay">@paulmmay</a>. See you there!
