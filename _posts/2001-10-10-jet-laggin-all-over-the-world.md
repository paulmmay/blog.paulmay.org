Things are all good. We arrived in Chicago yesterday, and are settling into our mildly eccentric hotel nicely. Its beige overtones and piped in musack are hilariously non-ironic. The imitation, indoor Bourbon Street here in the hotel has to be seen to be believed&#8230;it's tragi-kitch-tastic. There is also a hairdressing convention here this weekend&#8230;permarific.

Anyway, jet lag is featuring heavily today. Apologies for any typos featuring in this post. I hope you're well. Cliona, I miss you, see&#8230;I said I'd mention you :)
