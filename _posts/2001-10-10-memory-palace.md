<p class="intro">A short audio piece in response to visits to the Brooklyn Historical Society, The New York City Reliquary and the Tenement Museum.</p>
### Concept
The three museums we visited recently draw together stories and objects to tell us about the lives of ordinary people; simple physical objects used to link the visitor to deeper stories. 

This format reminded me of the Memory Palace mnemonic technique; the placement of imagined objects in an imagined space as a way of remembering a large amount of information. Recalling the information becomes a journey through an imagined space, rather than rote-recall. To explore this I asked three volunteers to close their eyes, and walk through the homes they grew up in - describing the spaces and objects they saw.

### The Project, Results

<object height="81" width="100%"> <param name="movie" value="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11687440"></param> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess="always" height="81" src="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11687440" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%"></embed> </object>&nbsp; <span><a href="http://soundcloud.com/paulmmay/memory-palace">Memory Palace</a> by <a href="http://soundcloud.com/paulmmay">Paul May</a></span> 

I was surprised that their recollections  of these spaces, objects, textures, materials - seemed so detailed; I would have a hard time describing the room I left ten minutes ago. 

Another thing I thought was interesting was the feeling I got that this type of recollection sat somewhere between remembrance and imagination/construction - I'm aware from the tiny bit of reading on neuroscience that the physical process of recalling a memory changes it <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/12/rewriting_fearful_memories_by_bringing_them_back_to_mind.php" title="through a process called re-consolidation">through a process called re-consolidation</a>. One participant even stated that they seemed to be remembering the home as they wanted it to be, before it had been renovated, and not as it actually existed now.

All in all, this was a very interesting exercise. I hope you enjoy it.
