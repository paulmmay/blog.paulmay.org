Day 2, and I thought I'd stretch my legs around our fair capital city. Walking up Parnell Street quickly, I turned the corner and then jogged up Gardiner Street nice and gently - then across the road to Mountjoy Square. I figured it'd be hard to judge distance or pace without some sort of guide - so the square was my guide. I walked the first lap and then ran the second, walked the third lap and then ran the 4th lap a little bit faster.

I kept upping the pace of the running until the 7th lap when I stepped up the pace on each side of the square, finishing flat out and then down to a fast walk and then some stretching. My heart-lung capacity is woeful, but at least I know that starting slowly I can keep running for a little while. Anyway, enough for today. More stretching and a chicken dinner.
