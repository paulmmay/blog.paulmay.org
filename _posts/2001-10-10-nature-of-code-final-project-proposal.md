<p class="intro">As my final project for Nature of Code I'm going to continue my experiments with Reynolds steering behaviours to create a pseudo-natural landscape of foraging creatures.</p>
### Summary
I've had a lot of fun lately programming little creatures to <a href="http://paulmay.org/blog/nature-of-code-reynolds-steering/" title="display life-like behaviours like finding food, wandering, fleeing threats">display life-like behaviours like finding food, wandering, fleeing threats</a>. There is just something weirdly compelling about tweaking and shaping the way the creatures behave. 

I'm going to continue this work. I'll create a landscape populated by a number of different species of creature who exhibit different behaviours. They'll be born, search for food, follow each other, flee from each other, seek shelter, reproduce and die. I'd like the creatures to have some sense of time and memory - things will happen depending on their age, and they'll be able to store information about their interactions. This information will inform their decision making. 

If I get time I may tie some of the attributes of the world to data from the real world; maybe some real weather data to inform weather in the world. Having any sort of direct communication between our world and the world of the creatures isn't something I'm certain that I want to pursue; we'll see. 

### The Creatures
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/6891472446/" title="01_creature_attributes by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6058/6891472446_5f735793ca_b.jpg" class="flickr" alt="01_creature_attributes"></a><br />
The creatures will have some basic capabilities; abilities to walk, run, consume food, follow others.&nbsp;

The creatures will want for things, they'll seek food, find a mate, flee from predators.

They creatures will organise themselves into groups based on their attributes.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/7037566183/" title="06_time by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7040/7037566183_fa787bd434_b.jpg"  class="flickr"  alt="06_time"></a><br />
The passage of time will influence the creatures' behaviour; during the day they will range far and wide energetically. At night they will seek shelter and stay close to one another.

### Landscape
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/6891473726/" title="05_island by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6105/6891473726_956904b16c_b.jpg" class="flickr" alt="05_island"></a><br />
The creatures will roam around on a landscape, probably an island of some sort - a space with natural boundaries.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/6891471134/" title="03_textures by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6117/6891471134_d7c19da143_b.jpg" class="flickr" alt="03_textures"></a><br />
The island will have some natural textures or types of terrain and the creatures will interact with these textures - feeding on them, avoid them etc.
