<p class="intro">For my Nature of Code class I'm going to make a little application that stores and represents information about little pieces of ephemera I find around my home. I call it Jetsom. </p>
I am getting to the end of my time at ITP; it's been an amazing two years. I am going to use my Nature of Code midterm, and probably final as a way to look back at the last few years through data and representation. 

Like a lot of people I seem to accumulate a lot of little items of paper and card; receipts, fliers, bills, menus. I keep some items deliberately because they represent memorable events, but most of it just accumulates - I've come to think of this as a form of **inadvertent record keeping**. 

For my Nature of Code project I'm going to **find** every item of this ephemera I can find in my home. I'm going to **scan** each item, creating an image, and then **store** this image and any useful information I know about the item in a database. 

I'll **feed** this data into Processing, and **represent** the data using computer graphics and sound. I would like the items to have aesthetic qualities and behaviours related to their origin - so I'll use data related to the item and a **physics** engine to power these qualities e.g. each new item finds other similar items, or flocks with items from the same time period.

My goal for the mid-term project is to find the physical items, scan and catalogue a subset of them, pull data into processing and represent them in some simplistic way. Over time I'll add more complexity.

I'll write more about the project over the next few weeks.
