I've just had confirmation that my spine hasn't been damaged, which is great news. I'll be starting physio at some stage this week, i'll keep you posted on the back injury. In the meantime, swimming and cycling proceed. [Good swimming session this morning with the usual 5 minutes of decent technique and 55 minutes of slogging away haplessly.]
