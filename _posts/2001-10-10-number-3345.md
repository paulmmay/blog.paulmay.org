<p class="intro">We've arrived, put the bikes back together, had a swim, cycled the run course and there's nothing left to do now but wait. </p>
Tomorrow I'll be up at 4.30am to set up my transition area at Lake Michigan, and at 7.41 I'll start the race. It's daunting, but I'm really looking forward to it. I've come a long way in a few months and I'm pretty confident that I can drag my bones around the course in one piece. 

If you'd like to track my progress you can use the <a href="http://triathlons.accenture.com/Chicago/register/CreateProfile.aspx" target="_parent">Athlete Tracking System</a>; you can get an email when i get out of the water, off the bike, and then when I cross the line. I'm number 3345.

Wish me luck!
