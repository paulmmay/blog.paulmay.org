<p class="intro">My first experiment with objects and object oriented programming in Processing.

This simple sketch creates a new object at runtime, then whenever the mouse it clicked. Each object creates a square on the screen wherever the mouse is. When you press any key all the objects are &#8220;killed&#8221; and the squares disappear. I had forgotten how powerful, and annoying, OOP is.
