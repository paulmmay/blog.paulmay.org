<p class="intro">We're off to Berlin to celebrate New Years and to finish off the Christmas Holidays. </p>
Hopefully, it'll be as great as it was when I was there for the World Cup - just colder, and with less football on the telly, obviously.

Yikes it's early. Off to stand in a queue at the airport :) Happy New Year!
