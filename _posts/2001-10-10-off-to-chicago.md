<p class="intro">My bike has been packed into a case the size of a small elephant, and the rest of my gear is packed and ready to go. </p>
Crumlin have given us some snazzy hoodies to wear while we're over there, so there'll be 35 people dressed the same with 35 bike boxes at the airport - we're sure to blend in :) Hopefully I'll keep you posted on prep before the race on Sunday - if not, I'll post after the race. Talk to you soon.
