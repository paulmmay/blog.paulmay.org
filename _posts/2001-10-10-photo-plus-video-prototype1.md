<p class="intro">A very quick video prototype of my final project for the intro to Physical Computing class at ITP. <a href="http://paulmay.org/itp/extending-physical-photos/" title="More information on the project is over here">More information on the project is over here</a>.

This is something I'm still noodling on; the video prototype was very helpful to get the order of interactions somewhat clear in my head. I also got some good feedback from the class; they encouraged me to think about the shared experience of the photograph - which is something I'll definitely think about.
