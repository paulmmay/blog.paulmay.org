<p class="intro">My cuts and bruises are healing well after the bike tumble. The swelling has gone down in my leg, and I was able to go to physio last night for a check up and to work on my (still) troublesome left side. </p>
Swimming this morning was a huge struggle, but I really pushed it and covered 2000m, which I'm really happy with. That's the longest I've swam (swum?) so far, and with a banjaxed leg. I left my bike into be fixed, so hopefully we'll both be back on the road by the weekend. Just keep going.
