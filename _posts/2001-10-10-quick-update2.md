Not a whole lot to report. Swimming is going well, and has boiled down to building my fitness and stamina; nothing too interesting, just slogging away two mornings a week :) Cycling on Sunday was <i>miserable</i> - torrential rain and 30mph winds for 65Km (Dublin to Maynooth and back). Running, yeah&#8230;running hasn't started back up yet other than a quick run last week. I need to get back on the horse (the metaphorical running horse).
