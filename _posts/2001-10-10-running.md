<p class="intro">Light physio exercises were the order of the day as I recovered from a twinge in my left leg. On the road to my first triathlon.</p>
Last night I did my physio exercises for the first time this week, then did a 20 minute warm up in the park, then a light jog and 20 minutes cycling. This morning there was no soreness in my left leg, and it looks like I'm back on track. I'm going to keep the level of the running very light for the next week, then get back to ramping up the distance. The good news is that I'm a bit ahead of my schedule with the swimming and cycling, so integrating the running back into the schedule should be possible in time for August.

The weather today is amazing, so hopefully the weekend will be good too.
