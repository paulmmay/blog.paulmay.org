<p class="intro">My first week at ITP has been great, and has also asked me to challenge the way I think about problem solving and creativity.</p>

This week, on more than one occasion, we've been told that what makes ITP special is a coming together of a diverse and talented group of people in a space that fosters collaboration and creativity. Our teachers are there to guide us, provoke us, offer feedback - but that **ultimately we are free to tailor our work along whatever path we choose** to explore new forms of media. Great, and terrifying, and great and also terrifying.

With a blank piece of paper, **I am inclined to want to solve a problem**. I will ask people about themselves, ask about their frustrations, gain whatever insight I can into what they struggle with - and then try to solve some aspect of the person's problem. I will do this through writing; breaking down the problem into clearer language, defining smaller sub-problems, working the problem like play-dough, describing it and potential solutions. I then work with others to express a solution to that problem as a <em>thing</em>.

At ITP we are more than free to solve problems, we can solve them all day long if that's what we choose to do - but we can also challenge the way people think about their environment, go against the grain of a trend, provoke a reaction or stir an emotion. This week has been challenging, because I've been shown that really great things can be created that don't necessarily map back to a problem that somebody has with the world**. 

### What's Next

In the next few months, years I will no doubt retain my own preference for practical problem solving, but I want to leave myself open to the idea that I'll make things that speak to something more personal and emotional as well. I am really happy that within days of coming to ITP I have had the chance to challenge my default outlook.

Here's a collection of stuff I've seen this week that has me thinking - you can decide for yourself whether it solves a problem, or raises an eyebrow.
