My legs ache, my arms ache - and I think I'm coming down with a cold. Hopefully this will get easier as the weeks go by, because at the moment I'm sore. I'll go along to circuits training tonight and see how the warm up goes. If I'm still sore then I'll sit out the session and swim tomorrow morning with (hopefully) better legs and arms. Nobody said this was going to be easy, no pain no gain, etc. :)
