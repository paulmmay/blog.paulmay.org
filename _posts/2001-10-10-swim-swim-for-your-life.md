Another great session with Aoife this morning, and while I can't say I'm getting the hang of swimming, it certainly wasn't the drown-fest of last week. This week I warmed up for 20 mintes following the routine we did at running yesterday, then stretching out my legs, arms and body before heading to the pool. 

We worked on my upper-body strength using the pull-buoy and hand paddles. We successfully diagnosed that I'm dragging my ass when I swim - which isn't really helping matters. Anyway, it was a good session - I'm not completely terrified of swimming with Piranha now; maybe I should be though.
