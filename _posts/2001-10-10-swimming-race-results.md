<p class="intro">I went for a swim last night, and then went swimming this morning as usual. Nothing too exciting to report.</p>
The <a href="http://www.triathlonireland.com/filemgmt_data/files/Blackrock%20Prov%20results%202006.xls" target="_parent">results</a> for the Blackrock Sprint are up. My times were:

**Swim (inc Transition 1): **00:14:01<br />
**Cycle:** 00:29:59<br />
**Run (inc Transition 2):** 00:32:08

Total time was 01:16:06. Pretty Happy with that.
