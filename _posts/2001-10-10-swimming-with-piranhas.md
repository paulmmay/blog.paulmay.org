I had my first swimming session with Piranha today, and it went well. I'm *by far* the weakest swimmer there, but they all have a couple of months training on me at least&#8230;so I didn't feel too bad. The coach worked on getting my hips up in the water, on my stroke and breathing, and i had improved a little bit by the end of the session. The soreness in my legs seemed to have improved by the end too. All in all I found the session tough going, especially with this damn cold, but well worth dragging myself out of bed at 6am. 5K running tonight, more swimming on Friday (and possibly one other evening this week). Joy abounds.
