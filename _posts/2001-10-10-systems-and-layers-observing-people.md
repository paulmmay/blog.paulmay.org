<p class="intro">Today I continued my observation of the intersection of Flatbush Avenue, Park Place and 7th Avenue in Brooklyn. Last time, I was looking at objects around this intersection which interact with a network of some kind. Today, I was observing human activity; it was a fascinating exercise. </p>
### Method
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/6189313084/" title="Survey - Ethogram Map Detail by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6020/6189313084_a67c1903ab_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="Survey - Ethogram Map Detail"></a><br />
My focus in this observation is to document the spaces where people congregate at the intersection and their interactions (at a very broad level). 

I broke the area I was observing into 6 **sections** (shown in pink on this rough map). I chose two **observation points**; a bus shelter at 1-2, and a table outside a cafe at 5-6. 

I made observations from these two points; sitting at point 1 for 60 minutes from 7.30am to 8.30am, then at point two for 30 minutes from 9am to 9.30am. I also spent 30 minutes taking photographs around the area (from 8.30am to 9.00am).

I decided to code the behaviour I saw in very loose **categories**:


* **Stop** - a person stops and lingers for some reason (e.g. buying something from a street vendor)
* **Wait** - a person stops and waits (e.g. waiting for a bus)
* **Look** - a person examines an object on the street (e.g. looking at a bus schedule)
* **Coup** - a pair/couple interact with each other. (e.g. a husband and wife interact at the bus stop) 
* **Group** - a group of more than two people congregate (e.g. a group of friends interact with each other)
* **Brief** - a brief interaction between people who pass on the street (e.g. two people pass and say hi to each other)


Again, these are loose categories with blurred edges. There are some cases where an observation could fall into more than one category. I've tried to get as close as possible to the interaction I observed - from my subjective point of view.

I decided to use a simple **ethogram** to document this activity. For each observation I recorded the **time**, the **section number** (from 1-6), the **category** of behaviour and some **notes**. Here's a snippet from my many, many pages of notes:

### Data Recorded
I made 81 observations in the 90 minute period - which I am now transcribing into a spreadsheet. I took 15 photos, which I've added to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/sets/72157627749963308/with/6189155132/" title="the set of photos taken in my first observation">the set of photos taken in my first observation</a>. 

### Key Observations
As the morning proceeded I noted down some key things I was seeing:


* Most people are in **transit**, moving through the area - remaining for a few minutes (**2-5 minutes**). 
* The **key period of activity lasted from 7.30am to 8.45am**, after that it became noticeably quieter.
* The bus shelter (area 2) is **a hub of activity** where people congretate.
* I observed **lots of family and social interaction at the bus shelter** (area 2).
* The **fruit seller **on the corner of 7th and Park Place is placed at a very good location (area 3).
* As** people walk Northeast up 7th Avenue, they turn onto Park Place** (area 3) heading towards the subway station on Flatbush (area 4), passing the fruit seller (area 3).
* The **bus service **that stopes on Flatbush (area 5) is far less frequent or popular than the service stopping on 7th Avenue (area 2).
* People **sometimes use street furniture/objects for novel purposes**; hanging clothing, resting bags.
* The **green space in the middle of the intersection - a small stand of trees - isn't traversed** by many people. It's essentially a traffic island.
* The **subway stop (7th Avenue BQ) is like a magnet**, drawing people up the block - chiefly from the direction of 7th and Park Place.
* People **interact very little with objects** that don't relate to their commute. There is very little interaction with any other object on the street.
* Interaction with the network layer of the city was almost entirely done through **cell phones**. One payphone call was observed.


### Next Steps
I'm compiling the observations into a spreadsheet so that they can be sorted and counted easily. I'll then add all the data onto a map, combining the observation of human activity with my survey of networked devices. As I continue to make observations at the intersection I want this map to build up into a useful document of the different layers of the urban experience.&nbsp; 

So, I'm very happy with my morning's work.
