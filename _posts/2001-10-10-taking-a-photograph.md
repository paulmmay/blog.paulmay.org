<p class="intro">I have been taking a lot of photos lately, and wanted to quickly jot down some thoughts on what I think is important to think about when I take a photo. You might find this useful, who knows.</p>

Wowsers, I have been taking a lot of photos in the last few months - maybe 1500 photos in the last month (shhh&hellip;maybe 200 of which were worth keeping&hellip;). This photo-fest has made me think about the things I think about when I take a photo. For me, taking a good photo boils down to 5 simple factors:

<ol>
* **Subject** - What or who am I taking a photograph? Is there any merit to this? Do I already have this photograph?
* **Attitude** - What is my relationship to the subject? Am I trying to capture a moment without intruding, or do I want them to connect with me through the camera? Should I be taking this photo?
* **Position** - Where am I standing? Should I move closer, or move away? Can I put myself in a position that makes this photo easier to take or better to look at?
* **Composition** - What am I putting into this photo and more importantly, what am I leaving out?
* **Light** - Is there enough light to take the photo? Where is the light coming from and what colour is it? Should I move? Should the subject move?
</ol>

Now, that's not to say that I am conscious of thinking of these things when I take a photo; some of this is just a habit - but usually when a photo <em>doesn't</em> work it's because one of these 5 things is out of balance. 

### The Camera is a Just Useful Constraint

The type of camera I use definitely has a role to play in taking a photo, but mostly in the way it influences these 5 things; it's a happy constraint, a useful set of parameters to work within:


* The camera **changes the subjects I'm able to photograph** - if I'm not able to move myself, then the subjects within my range of vision are the subjects I'm able to photograph.
* The camera, by influencing my physical position **changes my attitude to the subject**. If I am far away and out of sight then the subject is <em>observed</em> - this is a statement of intent and of how I see the subject. If I'm close to the subject, and they're aware of me, then that establishes a relationship of some kind.
* The camera **encourages me to frame things in particular ways** - the ratio of width to height lends itself to different subjects, the placement of the subject in the frame influences how the story of the photo unfolds when its viewed.
* My camera enables me to **expose the photo correctly** - or incorrectly/poorly - in the light I have available or the light I'm able to control. The photo is possible in the time I have, with the light I have, or it's not. The light <em>is the photograph</em> quite literally; from the light-source, to the subject to the lens and the sensor/film.


So, whatever camera I use will impose constraints, but ultimately I'm happy if I can get to understand these constraints and work within them to produce a good image.

### Letting the Equipment Go

When I was a child I took piano lessons, but I never really got to the point where I wasn't conscious of sitting at a keyboard playing a thing. If I had been better, then the piano would have been a constraint, but the quality of the music and performance would have been my concern. **The piano as an object melts away, the music is left. **Maybe that's the point with all hobbies or skills -&nbsp; the goal is to get beyond the point where the equipment/interface is a concern to the point where the quality of the outcome is a happy by-product of the fun you have doing the activity. 

I think that's where I'm starting to get with basic photography - I'm starting to think more about what's going on out there, what I'm trying to communicate, and less about the camera. **It's very easy, and sometimes fun, to get caught up in the equipment** - but the more I think about the gear, the less I'm thinking about the important stuff; the image, the fun.

Everything else is just practice I suppose.
