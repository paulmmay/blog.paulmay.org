<p class="intro">This week for my Evolution of Post-Print Media Class we were asked to discuss a trend affecting the "traditional media industry" (yes, that old chestnut). I've chosen to write about the end of format; the fragmentation of the ways in which we gain access to information, analysis and entertainment. This isn't a subject I have massively clear thoughts on (foreshadowing vagueness).</p>
### Content and Experience is Not the Same as Format
I am an avid reader of newspapers, books. I listen to the radio, go to the cinema. I use the web almost constantly. I am an equal opportunities media consumer. But wait, no. Is this accurate? Let me think about it. 


* I **like to know what is going on** in the world and I like intelligent, thoughtful analysis that tells me why what is happening now is important, or isn't. 
* I like** compelling stories written with care**; I like to lose myself in a world, to get to know new characters, to go on a journey.
* I like the **sound of the human voice** - the personal, enveloping warmth of speech.
* I l**ove my friends and family**. I want to feel close to them, to know what is going on with them. I want to know what is going on in the world, to get things done, to discover new things and people.


Over the years, I don't think these things have changed radically, but I now derive these benefits from lots of different places. 

It would be tempting to call this fragmentation - but only the delivery formats have fragmented, my desire for a good experience hasn't fragmented. 

In a sense, my relationship with information has never been more unified - but the common denominator/point of convergence is me - and not a small number of formats/titles. I am the medium.

### Building Flexibility not Formats

What would it take for a media organisation to thrive in a context like this?

A good starting point might be to understand how content converges in the lives of customers; who they are, why they value the things they do, what information information plays in their lives. 

The next step might be to assume that all formats, titles, mechanisms, devices and applications will continue to change rapidly - to the point where trying to pre-figure what they might look like is pointless. I don't get a sense that this is truly, deeply understood by traditional media companies. Clay Shirky <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/" title="wrote this in 2009">wrote this in 2009</a>:

<q>The problem newspapers face isn’t that they didn’t see the internet coming. They not only saw it miles off, they figured out early on that they needed a plan to deal with it, and during the early 90s they came up with not just one plan but several. [...] The unthinkable scenario unfolded something like this: The ability to share content wouldn’t shrink, it would grow. Walled gardens would prove unpopular. Digital advertising would reduce inefficiencies, and therefore profits.</q>

I think this is the only way to explain the way the response of most traditional media organisations to the web until very recently - the future that they had imagined, predicted, tried to bring about was fundamentally at odds with the desires of customers, and was too rigid to cope with a plurality of approaches.

Today, even today - the number of traditional media organisations building platforms and tools that cater for experimentation, partnership, intergration and collaboration still seems to be small. 

Alan Rusbridger of the Guardian <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/19/open-collaborative-future-journalism" title="talks about this">talks about this</a>:

<q>Most of these digital upstarts don't look like media companies. EBay? It buys and sells stuff. Amazon? The same. TripAdvisor? It's flogging holidays. Facebook? It's where teenagers post all the stuff that will make them unemployable later in life. If that's all we see when we look at those websites then we're missing the picture. [...] We should be relentless in learning all we can about how people are using this post-Gutenberg ability to create and share – and import those lessons back into our own journalism and businesses.</q>

His lecture also describes the huge efforts being made by the Guardian to re-imagine the role it plays in the lives of its customers, and to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform" title="build an open platform that allows them to be wherever these customers are">build an open platform that allows them to be wherever these customers are</a>. I can't think of a single, successful online company (Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon) that don't already have this at their core.

### Let's Land This

I am not sad about the demise of traditional media. These things happen. I would be very sad if the next 10 years gets us to a point there is no room for considered, diverse debate and probing journalism. I'll intergrate the experiences that deliver the things that are important to me into my life. I dont really care if those experiences are made by companies who used to print things on paper. 

Lots to think about.
