<p class="intro">Hello! I did the Port Tunnel run on Sunday, which was good fun. I haven't been running since the Dublin Aquathon back in September (?), so I was really bluffing it. Anyway, I made it home in a leisurely (read: crap) 59 mins&#8230;.7 minutes slower than my 10K leg in Chicago in August and about 30 minutes behind the decent runners.
</p>
10 thousand people huddled together on the approach to the tunnel for 30 minutes listening to the interesting blend of a local radio station van blasting out every song with the word &#8220;run&#8221; in it (Born to Run, Run To You&#8230;etc.) and the Starter shouting at people to get off the grass verge and that they were only kidding themselves. All good fun.

We started running (jogging) into the tunnel; from the grey winter light and the icy wind outside to the warm sodium glow and balmy 18 degree air inside. The contrast was wild; people were ditching jackets, santa suits and tracksuit bottoms all over the place. A leisurely jog later and we were back outside in the real world. The medal is very nice, well done to the organisers.

So, I'm going to try the Aware 10K on Sunday in the Phoenix Park, see if I can beat my pedestrian time. I'll give it a go anyway.

Hope you're all well.
