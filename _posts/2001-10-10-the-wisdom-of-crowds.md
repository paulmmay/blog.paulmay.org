An exercise in collective guesswork in Jer Thorp's class on Data Representation. </p>
Today in Jer Thorp's class we were asked to guess how many people are in <a href="http://paulmay.org/images/uploads/egyptnumbers.jpg" title="this image">this image</a>; earlier in the day, Jer had asked his followers on Twitter to do the same thing. This graphic is shows the spread of guesses from Twitter and ITP, with some outliers stripped out.

Before class, Jer divided the image into sections, and set up a Mechanical Turk job to count the actual number of people in each segment. Our homework for this week is to take the data returned from the Mechanical Turk job (a CSV file) and bring the correct number of people in the image to class next week. 

Obviously, he'd prefer if we parsed the CSV file with Processing.
