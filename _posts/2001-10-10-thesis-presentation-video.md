<p class="intro">This is the presentation I gave about my master's thesis project at ITP. My project was a semester-long collaboration with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The goal of the project was to investigate and improve the period of rehabilitation that follows a bone marrow transplant.

I carried out 6 weeks of detailed research at the hospital, then designed and built a service to encourage patients to remain physically active throughout their treatment.</p>
