<p class="intro">I am just past the mid-point of the research phase of my thesis; this week was mostly spent interviewing staff at MSKCC. </p>
As part of my thesis project, which I'm working on in colalboration with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, I'm conducting one month of desk and primary research - reading things, talking to people and observing. This week I completed five interviews with administrative and medical staff at MSKCC. The interviews are helping build a picture of the bone marrow transplantation process and the rehabilitation phase that follows. I've transcribed these interviews and have started to draw out key insights. 

Next week, I'll complete my round of interviews and will spend some time doing observation exercises at the hospital. After that I get into concept development - then prototyping.

Time is flying, but I'm very happy with the work completed so far.&nbsp;
