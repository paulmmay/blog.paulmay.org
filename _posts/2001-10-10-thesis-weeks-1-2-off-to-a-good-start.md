<p class="intro">For my thesis at ITP I am collaborating on a design project with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, one of the world's leading centres for cancer research and treatment. My project is to to understand and design improvements/interventions related to bone marrow transplantation; one of the most challenging forms of cancer treatment currently available to patients. In the first of my weekly updates I've written a bit about how the collaboration came about, what I hope to achieve with the project, and what I've been doing in the last few weeks. </p>
### Background

While at ITP I've had an opportunity to explore some themes that are deeply personal and relevant to me, including health and well-being. My family has a longstanding with cancer and I've used some of my projects at ITP as vehicles to understand the disease.

Last year I completed a project called <a href="http://paulmay.org/blog/we-are-working-on-it/" title="We Are Working On It ">We Are Working On It </a>- a visualisation of the many millions of scientific journal articles that have been written about cancer since 1980, presented alongside interviews with <a href="http://www.mskcc.org/research/lab/simon-powell/members" title="Ciara O'Driscoll and Laura Eccles">Ciara O'Driscoll and Laura Eccles</a>; two research scientists at Memorial Sloan-Kettering's Powell Lab. In my DIY Health class with <a href="https://twitter.com/sgdean" title="Steven Dean">Steven Dean</a> we spent a full semester working to research and design persuasive systems to improve health; my final project for that class was <a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/pilot" title="Pilot">Pilot</a>, a device to monitor, analyse and improve swimming technique. 

### Collaborating with Sloan-Kettering
During one DIY Health class Steven Dean mentioned that Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) had an innovation team whose job it was to design and improve the patient experience. This sounded really interesting, so I asked him to put me in touch with them. 

I met with the innovation team at MSKCC several times in the Autumn and Winter of 2011. They were incredibly open and welcoming to the idea of a collaboration. We talked about possible areas of focus, and identified the bone marrow transplantation process as of particular interest. This is a hugely challenging form of cancer therapy that pushes the human body to its limit - the team were interested in doing whatever they could to improve the experience of bone marrow transplantation, especially the long period of rehabilitation and recovery. We agreed that this would be my (broadly defined) area of focus.

I wrote a detailed project proposal and put it to MSKCC in December of 2011. The proposal broke the project down into four phases;** design research, prototyping, production and presentation**. I'd work closely with MSKCC to understand the bone marrow transplantation process in detail (through interviews and desk research). Based on this work I'd identify a number of insights and use them to define some sort of intervention in the experience of patients. The rest of the project would involve making this intervention real, testing it and presenting it/gathering feedback.

I got the go-ahead for the project in mid-January of 2012, and for the last two weeks have been working through the start of my research. 

### Weeks 1 &amp; 2: Crash Course

Since getting the go-ahead on the project I have really just had to dive into this world. I've done a good deal of **reading** on the bone marrow transplantation (BMT); focusing on** academic literature that describes the process and support material given to patients and their families to explain the disease**. I've done further reading on the process of rehabilitation and its many potential pitfalls. I've looked at the psycho-social aspects of the process and the roles that different people play in supporting the patient. 

The reading has allowed me to understand at a very basic level what bone marrow transplantation is, when its necessary, who is involved in the process and how recovery and rehabilitation work. 

I've also read **documentation given to me by the MSKCC innovation team** related to previous projects; they have worked with teams of outside designers in the recent past to develop concepts related to bone marrow transplantation. The work is pretty exceptional and the documentation has been immensely helpful, especially interview transcripts with medical staff, patients and families.

As well as desk research, this week I was able to** tour the bone marrow transplantation ward** at MSKCC with a member of the innovation team. We walked through the space to see where key steps of the process happen, and I was able to **take photos and an audio recording** documenting what I saw. 

### Next Steps

Next week I really want to** take all that I've learned in the last few weeks and make it more tangible/concise**; I'll take my written notes and start to **boil them down into little nuggets of information, key insights and quotes**. Now that I have a grounding in the basics I can start to talk to people involved in the process; so next week I'll **interview members of the innovation team and medical staff**.&nbsp; 

I've allowed for two more full weeks of research before I move on to concept development and prototyping; not a lot of time, but hopefully enough to inform the rest of the project.
