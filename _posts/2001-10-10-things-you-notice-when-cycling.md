<p class="intro">When cycling in Dublin you notice a few things; broken glass, jelly legs, potholes!</p>
Be aware that:

<ol>
* Tiny potholes become <em>big</em> problems when your wheels are an inch wide.
* Motorists don't see you, or care about you
* There's broken glass <em>everywhere</em>
* Walking when you get off a bike is tricky enough, running should <em>loads</em> of fun
* If you've never cycled in clipless cycling shoes (the ones that lock to the pedals) practice before you go out in traffic
</ol>

Anyway, a good spin out on the bike, onwards and upwards. Total distance covered was 13.6 miles = 21.9 kilometers.
