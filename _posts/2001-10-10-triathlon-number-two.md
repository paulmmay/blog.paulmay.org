<p class="intro"></p>
With 24 hours notice I've been given a spot in <a href="http://www.triathlone.com" target="_parent">Triathlone</a> which is taking place *tomorrow*!!! It's a 750m swim, 20k cycle, 5k run in Athlone (in case you hadn't guessed). I'm going to give it a go - see how I get on. This may be my last chance to do a sprint before Chicago, so I should really take it.

Bloody hell though, cutting it fine!
