<p class="intro">TriAthlone gets better and better and better; this was my third time "attending" the race, but this time only as a spectator. It was a very enjoyable day.</p>

### Patsy Lagan Kicks Ass
We had a fantastic time at TriAthy at the weekend. Unfortunately I wasn't in good enough shape to do the race, but went along to cheer on my Front colleague Patsy Lagan who was taking part. She kicked ass, and had a great time doing her first triathlon. 

### Bigger &amp; Better
What can you say about TriAthlone? **It gets bigger and better each year**. The race is immaculately organised - it's fun and safe for spectators, and from what I could see, a great experience for competitors. This year the race featured a new swim layout (the swim has been hellish in recent years, as the current at Athlone is incredibly strong) and a new transition area within Athlone barracks. 

I couldn't tell how many people were taking part, but it seemed like thousands. **The whole town had basically been given over to what was, up until recently, an obscure sport in Ireland.** I know this is pass&eacute; but triathlon's growth just surprises and delights me with every race I see or compete in. 

I'm going to make Triathlone 2010 a key target race, most definitely; it's unfortunate that I didn't get to take part in such a great day. **Next year Athlone, next year.**
