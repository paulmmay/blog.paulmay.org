Vito Acconci came to speak to us in September 2010. He is quite a character and even his early work is still provocative.

I was really interested in the way he talked about his work as a series of attempts - he never seemed to truly happy with his work; every expression was followed by doubt and a new attempt to get closer to whatever felt more honest.
