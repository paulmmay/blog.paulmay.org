<p class="intro">A new, bold, devil may care chapter of life begins; from September 2009 onwards I'll be back in Dublin showing the whipper snappers how it's done. </p>
In case you don't already know, I've spent the last 2 years working with <a href="http://www.designbyfront.com" title="Front">Front</a> in Belfast during the week and then squeezing in some time in Dublin at the weekends. This has been pretty interesting; a great opportunity to live in a new place and the right career move,&nbsp; but tough at times with significant amounts of time spent travelling and too much time spent away from friends and family. **Well, things are changing for the better. **

I'll now be working in Belfast Monday-Wednesday and from a in Dublin on Thursday and Friday. **Effectively I'll now be spending over 50% of my week in Dublin for the first time in a couple of years**. This is going to be hugely positive for me and Cliona - we'll be able to live together for the first time, plan our wedding and do all the things that people take for granted like (gasp) eat dinner together and (wow) buy groceries and (ooh) learn to drive a car. 

**We've spent the last couple of weeks searching for a new place to live in Dublin** and have found a great apartment very close to Parnell street where Cliona lives now. I'm also moving to a much smaller place in Belfast to cut our costs; happily it's all been pretty smooth and hassle free. Unlike previous times when I've been house hunting in Dublin there was no shortage of choice, so we were able to be choosy.

**Yes, I will continue to work with Front, they rock **; I'll now have lots **more time to work with our Dublin clients, which can only be a good thing**. If you're in Dublin, and you need help to <a href="http://designbyfront.com" title="improve, design, build an awesome web application">improve, design or build a web application</a> - <a href="http://paulmay.org/contact">do get in touch!</a>.

So, that's a big announcement out of the way. I'll be writing about the transition/Dublin base in more detail over the coming months.** Wish us luck!**
