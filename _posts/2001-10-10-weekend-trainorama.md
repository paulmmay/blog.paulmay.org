Just a quick update before I run out the door. On Friday I had a very positive swimming session, and I felt like my technique was pretty good (in comparison to previous weeks). Fitness is still terrible, but working on it. Instead of the club run on Saturday (still have some pain in my back and left side, so not back running yet) I did a short swim in Belvedere pool. I only did 30 minutes, but it felt good. Today (Sunday) was great; I met up with people from Piranha and 3D tri clubs in the Phownix park and we did a long 50K+ cycle out into West Dublin, then into Meath and back. The weather was perfect, and I really enjoyed the cycle (despite nearly falling after running into the back of Pras's bike).

Right, that's all for now. Physio tomorrow.
