I'm now the proud owner of a <i>very</i> snug Zoot Z2 wetsuit. I tried on a few suits, and swam in them, but this one fitted the best (and it wasn't too pricey either). My first sea-swim is on Sunday evening, I'll keep you posted on that.

Okay, I'll admit is. I slacked off and didn't go swimming on Tuesday. I had been working late, and my body just needed a rest. Today, I did go, and had a great swim. My fitness is slowly improving and my technique is much better than a month ago (I know I keep harping on about "technique", but the training has made all the difference). There were a few interesting cramp moments where my left calf clumped into a fist-shaped knot, but I got through it with some stretching.

More physio stretches tonight, light run tomorrow (my first since hurting my left side, cycle and swim on sunday).
