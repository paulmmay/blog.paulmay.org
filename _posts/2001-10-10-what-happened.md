<p class="intro">What Happened is a (forthcoming) visual exploration of Irish society, economy and environment from 1980 to 2010. 

What Happened is my own small attempt to gain/share a better understanding of Ireland's past as a way of understanding what might happen next.

### Outline Approach
What Happened aggregates information from public records/data-sets, media sources and social networks to build a time-line of events over the last 30 years. It allows users to step through this time-line, view and download segments of the data and contribute their own thoughts. It will be presented online and in a physical installation.

### Progress
I'm still at the very early stages of thinking about this idea and would love some feedback. I am confident that by juxtaposing different perspectives and data the end result will be informative, maybe even fun. 

### Next Steps
I need to talk to as many people as possible about the outline idea, then refine an elevator pitch - it's obviously still vague. After that I'll do a round of more in-depth research before getting into design, development , feedback cycles.
