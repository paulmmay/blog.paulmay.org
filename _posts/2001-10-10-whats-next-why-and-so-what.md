<p class="intro">Thinking ahead to year two of ITP and the why and so what of my work.</p>
A few years ago I was at a conference in San Francisco where Tim O'Reilly gave a keynote speech. He drew together some threads of the conference (which had featured the work a organisations using technology to involve citizens in the work of government) into one thought; <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html" title="Work on Stuff that Matters">Work on Stuff that Matters</a>.&nbsp; His basic idea was that technology and people designing new uses for technology have a key role to play in improving the world - but that this could only happen if people working in design and technology valued more than just commercial value (selling out at the first opportunity) and took a long term view of our work (incremental/small improvements leading to big changes/changes at scale). 

The talk has stayed with me over the years; I come back to it when I think about new projects. I try to work on projects that are connected to a &#8220;why&#8221; - a motivation, a desire or a problem, and that have a &#8220;so what&#8221; - an impact beyond the project, even if it's only to move a tiny idea forward a little bit in my own head.

Last year at ITP I had the chance to work on things that were both personal to me and connected to a somewhat longer term idea; whether it was the idea that my photos <a href="http://paulmay.org/blog/photoplus" title="connected me to stories">connected me to stories</a> that themselves change as time passes, or that data could <a href="http://paulmay.org/blog/from-over-here" title="tell me about where I'm from">tell me about where I'm from</a> - I gravitated towards things that matter to me. 

This was good and bad. Because the projects were personal and worthwhile to me I worked hard on them, was proud of the outcome and gained real personal insight. On the other hand personal projects are naturally hard to build a team around. I chose to work on my own more than I would have liked and missed out on some lightness, fun and experimentation that could have come from a more social approach.

In the next year I want to continue to work on things that are personal to me and to work on things that have the capacity to move ideas forward - but I also want to find a balance between these things, teamwork and fun. I don't think any of these motivations are incompatible - but I think it'll be positive to have a more complex center of gravity to my projects.

Of course, what exactly all that means is to be determined in year two at ITP.
