**A response to the first chapter of _This Is Your Brain On Music_ by Daniel J. Levitin.**

At age 25, 10 years of which were spent learning piano and saxophone, and most of the rest listening to music I had heard many of the terms defined in the first few pages of _What Is Music?_ but knew them more as vague notions and emotions than technical definitions. The most surprising bit was that pitch and loudness are wholly mental constructs. I had always thought of pitch and loudness as pitch and loudness and that is just how it is.

I had casually wondered how different instruments generated different sounds when playing identical notes. It wasn’t a matter of the frequency so what could it be? I’m trying to wrap my head around overtones. It is still unclear if overtones are a finite set of frequencies or if they exude from the fundamental tone upwards forever. Is there any reason the overtones aren’t undertones?

Shapes of graphs instantly popped in to my head while reading that varying loudnesses of overtones influence the timbre of a sound. Could it be possible to make a morphable graph to create any sound desired? Of course this is a synthesizer, but I really want to create a program that allows the user to draw the shape of the overtones and click and drag at individual points as a experimentation for the shape that sounds from instruments create.

The section describing the tonal system and fractions and differences between keys and how if a piece is written in C but the note distribution is more like A… I got lost on this. Reading about it was not very enlightening without being able to the scales out with a real instrument. So I got out a MIDI keyboard and did try to noodle about, and it’s starting to make sense.
