I'm presenting Floorsquare at the ITP Winter Show.

The project is an interactive directory of the students and faculty currently on the floor at ITP. It's purpose is to give a glimpse at what is going on around the floor as you first enter. What projects are being presented? Who is around offering help in certain subjects.

Checking in to Floorsquare currently requires an NYU ID card. The app also serves as an open API for other student projects wishing to access student directory information.

Floorsquare is a group project with Jeremy Scott Diamond, Zach Schwartz, Lily Szajnberg, Noah Crowley, Meghan Hoke, Gabby Levine, Greg Dorsainville & Matt Tennie.
