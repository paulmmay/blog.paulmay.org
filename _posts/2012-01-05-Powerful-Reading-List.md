Last semester I took a course titled **Powerful Ideas: Useful Tools to Understand the World**. It was taught by Nancy Hechinger and Alan Kay came in once a month as well as wrote us each week via email.

Throughout the class many, many books were mentioned. Way more than could be read in one semester, more even than I could manage in a year. This list is a great addendum to Alan Kay's own [reading list](http://www.squeakland.org/resources/books/readingList.jsp).
