The first assignment in [Pixels to Polygons](http://jamesgeorge.org/3dworlds/) was to build a space from memory using only Unity's primitive shapes placed and manipulated entirely through scripting.

## Remembering a Place

For my space I chose the view from an orange couch that used to be at the coffee shop from my college town. It was a spot where I spent much of my final two years at Kenyon College while doing homework and hanging out. There was a matching orange chair to the left and then a large south facing window with many trees just outside.

## New Territory

I've spent almost the last year in web programming and the command line, manipulating documents and text. Though my first year at ITP involved a lot of Processing I rarely moved in to 3D environments and when I did, the use of pushing and popping the matrix is different than Unity's use of vectors for positioning.

The hardest part, and where I spent many hours, was finding out the hard way which primitives are best to use for what purpose. The floor plan of the coffee shop was not a simple rectangle but had two sections butting out with triangular corners. Due to these two triangular corners I decided it would be easiest to build the entire floor out of a series of triangles. This route didn't work to well, it required a lot of lines of code and did not seem efficient. Before figuring out how to best tackle the floor I decided to build the orange chair. After a poor reading of James George's `GeometryHelper` class I did not realize that cubes in Unity could be deformed to solids with different sides of different lengths. Without this knowledge I proceeded by building the chair out of a series of planes.

Wow, that was difficult and didn't work well. Finally I figured out the `CreateCube` function which made everything much easier. Rotations are hard to achieve with scripting. The command for rotating a camera takes a vector for where to point towards yet the UI gives degrees of rotation.

The final result is very plain and not too lush. My false starts were frustrating but I learned a lot about programming in 3D. Using scripts to individually place and rotate every item is very time consuming and I look forward to using Unity's UI to build the objects and then scripting behaviors. The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/stevenklise/MiddleGround).
