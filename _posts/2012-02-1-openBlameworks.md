**This idea is the result of watching way too much Law & Order, working on group projects and being brand new to openFrameworks. It is also a terrible pun.**

Our first assignment in [Appropriating New Technologies](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/AppropriatingNewTechnologies) is to capture a video stream and augment it.

When openBlameworks detects a face, or many faces, it randomly chooses one to "blame." Blaming happens by rendering a few hand written captions with arrows pointing to the face and telling them it was their fault, or that they did it.

I've been working through the first few seasons of Law & Order and frequently feel like I know who the killer is before the police do. openBlameworks attemps to tell the officers that it was that person, that awful murderer.

And then there is [git blame](http://book.git-scm.com/5_finding_issues_-_git_blame.html).



$ git blame

there are many powerful commands offered by Git, however none more cathartic than `$ git blame`.

nothing to make you feel more powerful than laying down some blame when you can't get past 500 errors or compiling issues.
