*Chillin' In Space* is a navigable NASA boneyard & veritable chill spot that I made with [Alejandro Crawford](http://amjc.tv) in Unity3D. The objective to *Chillin' In Space* is to do exactly that, chill in outerspace. We've littered space with various NASA artifacts, like Voyager and the Space Shuttle, as well as a few Star Trek models, the shuttle craft and space dock. The space program's past is intermingled with a future as imagined when the NASA artifacts were new. The astral explorer is invited to either think about this or just hang out and look at the stars.

Using an Arduino, an accelerometer, two momentary buttons and a potentiometer we built a control box for the program. One applies forward thrust, the amount of thrust is determined by the potentiometer, labelled "Chill Rate." The other button slows the craft to a halt. Changing direction is achieved by flicking the control box in the desired direction.
