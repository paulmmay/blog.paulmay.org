I carried out eight weeks of design research including interviews and workshops with patients, former patients, healthcare and administrative staff at Sloan-Kettering. I developed a web application called Activity App based on the findings of this research. 

Activity App applies principles of persuasive design to encourage Sloan-Kettering's bone marrow transplant patients to remain physically active throughout their treatment and gives clinicians useful data about their patients' level of physical activity.

I then worked with Sloan-Kettering to write a section of a protocol that will allow Activity App to be tested with patients as part of a forthcoming clinical trial.
