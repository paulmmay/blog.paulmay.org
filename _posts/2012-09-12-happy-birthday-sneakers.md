20 years ago today the film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105435/">Sneakers</a> was released. It's one of my favorite films; I have watched it dozens of times. It's essentially a fun, nerdy B-movie caper with an A-list cast including Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, River Phoenix, Dan Aykroyd and Ben Kingsley. The story has a simplicity and a completeness that I find really satisfying, and a score by James Horner that really moves things along nicely.

<blockquote>For me, Sneakers occupies a special category: It’s a movie I can watch again and again and never get tired of; it’s the movie I happily settle on when every other DVD or download doesn’t quite suit my mood. I think I find it so trusty because it’s action-packed without being too violent, and smart without taking itself too seriously. And, perhaps most important, it’s perfectly paced: Even when you know every scene by heart, not one of them feels like it lasts a second longer than it needs to.</blockquote>
