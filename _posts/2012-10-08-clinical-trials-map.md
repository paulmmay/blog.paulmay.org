strapline: Maps of biomedical clinical trials.
description: A clinical trial studies the effectiveness of a bio-medical approach or technology. A registry of clinical trials from many countries is available to the public; this project takes that data - presenting current and forthcoming clinical trials in a more relevant, spatial context.

My goal with this project was to offer an alternative, more accessible interface to a complex, scientific topic. By using a map to present clinical trials data, it's possible for people to see where clinical trials are happening nearby - maybe prompting them to find out more about the type of research being done. 

The data presented on the map is updated at least once a week and I continue to roll out small improvements to the project.
