strapline: A remotely piloted flying camera.
description: Developed as my undergraduate thesis project with Tim Twomey, Eyeship was a remotely piloted airship that captured TV quality video and sensor data, relayed that content to a ground station, which then streamed it live on the web.

Our goal with this project was to demonstrate an alternative approach to traditional aerial camerawork - usually done with cranes and booms. 

We developed Eyeship, a highly capable aerial camera platform and ground station. Eyeship featured a high quality camera and video transmitter for the core video applications. It also featured a small onboard computer, sensor package and packet radio system that could send altitude and other useful data back to the ground station.

In the intervening years, remotely piloted vehicles like Eyeship have become widely available and we are proud to have been somewhat ahead of that trend.
