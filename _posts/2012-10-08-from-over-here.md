From Over Here is constructed from hundreds of individual cards. The length of each card represents the number of articles published in the New York Times related to Ireland. The people and topics mentioned in those articles are etched on each card. 

When stacked on top of one another, the cards show the ebb and flow of interest in Ireland - culminating in a dramatic peak during the worst months of Ireland's financial crisis in 2009. 

The project received widespread coverage and is featured in the Gestalten book <em><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/10/25/visual-storytelling-gestalten/">Visual Storytelling</a>: Inspiring a New Visual Language</em>.
