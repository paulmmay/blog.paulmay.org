strapline: A tactile sculpture made from big data.
date: 08-03-2011
description: From Over Here is a sculpture shaped by news data - it represents coverage of Ireland in the New York times over two decades. 
---
From Over Here is constructed from hundreds of individual cards; with each card representing one month of articles related to Ireland. The size of each card shows the numbers of articles from that month. The people and topics mentioned in those articles are etched on each card. 

When stacked on top of one another, the cards show the ebb and flow of interest in Ireland - culminating in a dramatic peak in the most dramatic months of Ireland's financial crisis in 2009. 

The project received widespread coverage and was been featured in one of the Gestalten book <em>Visual Storytelling: Inspiring a New Visual Language</em>.
