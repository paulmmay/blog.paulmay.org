Cards are held in place on a vertical rail, and can be moved left and right around the rail as a person explores the sculpture.","In May 2008, people and topics in the news included Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen (the then former and current prime ministers), foreclosures, ethics investigations, and elections.","From Over Here features hundreds of cards, stacked on top of one another, to a height of nearly 4 feet.","Data from the New York Times was pulled into custom software, which  calculated the size of each card, and rendered its shape precisely. Shape files were sent to a laser cutter, producing individual cards. The cards were then stacked on a vertical rail."]

strapline: A sculptural representation of two decades of news. 
date: 08-03-2011
description: From Over Here is physical representation of news data, constructed of hundreds of individual cards. Each card in the sculpture represents one month of New York Times articles mentioning Ireland, spanning the period 1992-2010. The length of each card is mapped to the number of articles in a given month. The people and topics mentioned in those articles are etched on each card. The project is featured in the Gestalten book <em><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/10/25/visual-storytelling-gestalten/">Visual Storytelling</a> - Inspiring a New Visual Language</em>, and has been displayed in a number of gallery shows.

When stacked on top of one another, the cards show the ebb and flow of interest in Ireland - culminating in a dramatic peak during the worst months of Ireland's financial crisis in 2009.
