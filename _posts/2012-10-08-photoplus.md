strapline: Store audio memories in physical photos.
description: Photo+ is a device designed to facilitate collective storytelling projects. It allows a person to make an audio recording of their voice - a memory, story or description - and then "attach" that story to a physical photograph. At any time in the future, a person can simply place their photo back on Photo+, and their story will be re-played. They can visit a unique URL for their photograph, and hear their story online. Photo+ extends the capabilities of physical photographs with new technology, while preserving the centrality of a physical artifact to act of remembering.

To begin using Photo+ the user pushes a button and a unique tag is printed for them. The person affixes the tag to the back of their photo and places it on a stand. 

The stand senses the presence of the photo and starts to record using a built-in microphone. The person speaks about the photograph - its content, its meaning - and then removes the photo from the stand. The recording of their voice is saved to a web service. 

Whenever the person want to hear the audio again they can place the photo back on the stand and their recording will be re-played. They can also use their smartphone to scan the tag on the back of the photo - this will retrieve and play the recording.
