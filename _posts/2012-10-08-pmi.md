strapline: A physical, gesture based computer interface.
date: 08-12-2003
description: In 2003 I worked with Kevin Cannon to build a system that allowed a user to control a computer using the motion of his/her hand. This system was called Physical Motion Interface (PMI) and was designed to enable expressive, gestural control of a computer use cheaply available parts.

PMI used a webcam to track the position of two LEDs on an interface glove, translating the position of those LEDs into six recognisable gestures. In our demonstration software, these six gestures were tied to the control of a video player - by gesturing right and left the video would play, fast forward, pause, rewind. Gesturing up and down controlled audio volume. 

I was responsible for implementing the image tracking and gesture recognition. Kevin designed, prototyped and developed the interface glove.
