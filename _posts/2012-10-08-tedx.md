strapline: My TEDx talk on data and storytelling.

description: Working with data has become really important in my research and design work.

In 2011 I worked on a number of projects that took large sets of data related to Ireland, where I'm from, and incorporated those datasets into sculptures, graphics and stories. I <a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxGallatin-Paul-May-Data-Repr">gave a TEDx talk</a> at NYU's Gallatin School about this work. 

In <a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxGallatin-Paul-May-Data-Repr">the talk</a>, I described the confusing, messy, challenging and ethically fraught process of working with data - and the rich sense of personal meaning I got from the work. I spoke about the richness I discovered in this type of work; a richness that is often not represented in the end results - such as graphics. 

I encouraged people to think about questions and issues that were personally meaningful to them, and then to get their hands dirty with data to see what they themselves could discover.

I enjoyed the talk immensely and have continued to think about and work on projects related to big data since then.
