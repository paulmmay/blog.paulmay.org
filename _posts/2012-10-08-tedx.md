strapline: My TEDx talk on data and storytelling.
date: 10-04-2011
description: Gathering and analyzing data is central to my research and design projects. In 2011 I worked on a number of projects that took large sets of data related to Ireland, where I'm from, and expressed those datasets as sculptures, graphics and stories. I <a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxGallatin-Paul-May-Data-Repr">gave a TEDx talk</a> at NYU's Gallatin School about this work.

In <a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxGallatin-Paul-May-Data-Repr">the talk</a>, I described the messy and ethically fraught process of working with data - and the rich sense of personal meaning I got from doing this sort of work. 

I encouraged people to think about questions and issues that were personally meaningful to them, and then to get their hands dirty with datasets and analysis tools freely available online.
