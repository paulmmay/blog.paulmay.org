strapline: My TEDx talk on data and storytelling.

description: Finding and analyzing data has become central to my research and design work.

In 2011 I worked on a number of projects that took large sets of data related to Ireland, where I'm from, and incorporated those datasets into sculptures, graphics and stories. I <a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxGallatin-Paul-May-Data-Repr">gave a TEDx talk</a> at NYU's Gallatin School about this work. 

In <a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxGallatin-Paul-May-Data-Repr">the talk</a>, I described the messy and ethically fraught process of working with data - and the rich sense of personal meaning I got from doing this work. This more emotional side to data was not something I felt was represented in the end results of big data projects.

I encouraged people to think about questions and issues that were personally meaningful to them, and then to get their hands dirty with the freely available datasets and analysis tools available online.

I enjoyed the talk immensely and have continued to work on projects related to big data since then.
