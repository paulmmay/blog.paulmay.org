description: While working with <a href="http://www.designbyfront.com" title="Front">Front</a> I had the privilege of working on a new online presence for Abbey Theatre. strapline: A new online home for Ireland's National Theatre
---
As Ireland's national theatre, Abbey Theatre has shaped Ireland and the idea of Ireland since it was founded by W.B. Yeats in 1904. 

Abbey Theatre came to Front in 2009 and asked us to re-develop their site from the ground up. I was responsible for the research, requirements gathering and experience strategy for the new site, working closely with the Theatre's marketing, design and technical teams. 

The new site was created to give both Irish people and visitors to Ireland *unprecedented insight* into the workings of the theatre, and to offer an online experience that felt like *a natural extension* of a visit to the Theatre. 

We gave the Theatre's backstage departments a home on the site, and coached them as they started to blog and show their work. 

We developed the first online interface to Abbey's <a href="http://www.abbeytheatre.ie/archives">extensive archive</a>; a treasure trove of Irish cultural history. 

We completely re-developed the ticket purchasing experience so that customers could see a photo-realistic view from their seat when making a purchase - something no other Irish theatre offered at the time. 

The project was very meaningful for me, and I'm proud of the results. The site has continued to flourish since its launch.
