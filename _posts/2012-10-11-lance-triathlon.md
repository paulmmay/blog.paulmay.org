The article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/sports/cycling/lance-armstrong-draws-mixed-reception-from-triathlon-community.html">Armstrong Finds a Mixed Reception in Triathlon</a> in the New York Times really got my goat this morning.

Lance Armstrong has been completely banned from the internationally governed (i.e. non-corporate) forms of triathlon because he used drugs to cheat in cycling. Giving the impression that there's a debate about Lance, or "mixed feelings" among triathletes is shabby.

If a golfer was banned from playing tournaments, but was still allowed to play big-drive competitions and crazy golf, you would call that <em>being banned from playing golf</em>. I don't understand the false equivalence between Lance being allowed to race by a tiny number of rogue races and "mixed feelings" among triathletes. A really shabby piece of post-truth journalism.
