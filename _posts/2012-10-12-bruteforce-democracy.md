When Crackerjack found the combination of numbers and letters that when, lightly encrypted, matched the string in the password file - the computer would beep. 

I'd get up from the dinner table and walk to the computer in our living room. I'd see what password this particular user had chosen and how long the program had left to run. 

By the next day I would have access to hundreds of UNIX accounts at a nearby university. I would telnet in, look around, then log off. The fun part was over, and being 13 I lacked the imagination to do anything creative, let alone malicious with the accounts. This was just an incremental step along the path of Lego, magnets, my microscope, a 286, our first modem.

In the last few weeks here in the US I have remembered and thought repeatedly about this long-lost time. 

It's election season, and there is something about the quality of the discourse here that reminds me of brute force password cracking; candidates rapidly cycling through a set of signs in an attempt to elicit a desirable signal. Word, sentence, image, emotion out - data, refinement, ballot in. 

The mind of the voter is the hashed password, the barrel of a lock. The home directory, the other side of the door - they are not concerns for today.
