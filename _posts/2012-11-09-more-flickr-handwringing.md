I wrote this as a comment on <a href="http://stewf.tumblr.com/post/35334085915/flickr-is-dead-long-live-flickr">Stephen Coles' article</a> about Flickr and thought it was probably worth snipping and keeping; maybe even expanding upon some time. The crux of Stephen's original article is this paragraph:

> Flickr is certainly not the all-purpose photography social network it once was. There is no doubt Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and other more immediate, accessible, and — most importantly — mobile-savvy venues took that position. But Flickr is still a haven for professional photography, and for the visual documentation of specialized fields, because nothing is better for tagging, archiving, organizing, research, collaborating, curating, and finding others who share your particular interest. 

I see what you're saying, but Flickr is not commercially viable as a place for "professional photographers" (whatever that means anymore). It needs the blend of subscription revenue, mass-participation, exposure to advertising and experimentation that have supported it since it launched. It needs that long tail of people who are trying it out and who might become a subscriber. It needs the huge percentage of people who might upload dozens or hundreds of photos, but look at thousands. 

Flickr has always done a good job of focussing on doing a limited number of things really well; sharing, interoperability (its API), privacy, tagging, annotating photographs, the Commons - they designed the state of the art for much of what we take for granted in media sharing on the web. However, Flickr has failed to shift its relevance as the context and culture of photography has changed. 

Flickr hasn't responded in any way to the growth of mobile photography - the most significant thing to happen to reportage photography and photography aesthetics in decades. The mobile applications it has released have done little more than damage its brand.

Since Heather Champ departed Flickr efforts to foster and understand the Flickr community have really withered on the vine. They've lost other, similarly talented folks in design, engineering - these people have found homes in start-ups and other more dynamic online services. 

I could go on. 

Flickr is becoming (a) a storage device and (b) a community of people who regard themselves to be above the churning sea of content being produced by everyday photographers. It was never designed to be either. The subscription cost is cheap for the value that Flickr offers in isolation, but seemingly expensive when compared to other services. 

Flickr has lost its way - it's in the expensive mainframe business when the world is buying desktops; it panders to an idealised customer as the actual customer moves on. It's being made irrelevant by a changing context.

Having said all of that, it could come back, it has the potential to come back - but not without taking a good look at how photography actually exists in people's lives today, not what an elite think photography should be - then designing for those needs. It's an exciting prospect, they can do it; I very much hope they do - but time is running out.
