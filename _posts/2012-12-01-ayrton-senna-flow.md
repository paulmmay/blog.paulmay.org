In the documentary <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1424432/">Senna</a></em>, Ayrton Senna describes his mental state during the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix. 

> That day I suddenly realised that I was no longer driving it conscious, and I was in a different dimension for me. The circuit for me was a tunnel, which I was just going, going goingâ€¦and I realised I was well beyond my conscious understanding.

Since watching the film this morning I've been thinking about human-machine interfaces (for the first time in a while). I wonder whether the type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi">experience</a> Senna describes requires an interface so simple that it melts into the background. What are the critical ingredients of an experience like this? When is an experience like this undesirable? These aren't new questions, but again - I have haven't thought about them in a while.

<p class="footnote">Incidentally, in the race Senna built up a substantial lead over Alain Prost before crashing out on the 65th lap. </p>
