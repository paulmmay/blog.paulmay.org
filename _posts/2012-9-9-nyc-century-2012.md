I did the NYC Century yesterday; a 100 mile cycle around Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and The Bronx. 

We set out from Central Park just after 6am, cruised down into Brooklyn and Prospect Park, then out to Coney Island, Breezy Point, the Rockaways, Forest Park, Little Neck, Flushing, Astoria, The Bronx, Harlem to the finish. The total distance was about 104 miles. 

The Century was a great way to see parts of New York I would never ordinarily visit. The day has left me with an even greater appreciation for this wonderful city.

Congratulations to my fellow centurions Matthew, Will and Miguel. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22463687@N05/7967084832/" title="Centurions by Clionac, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8461/7967084832_92c38c45c8_c.jpg" width="800" height="455" alt="Centurions" class="photo"></a>
