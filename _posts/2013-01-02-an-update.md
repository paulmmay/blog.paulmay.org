It's been a while since my last update, I'm back in college now and the deadlines are already piling up. Currently I'm working on a CD-ROM about Stanley Kubrick, a Flash piece based on Jason and the Argonauts, a 3D modelling project, and a ridiculously complicated Weather Forecasting tool which lets you access weather station data from your computer (being written in Director). So, it's busy busy busy.

In other news, I need a job, because contrary to popular belief, money doesn't grow on trees. If you need a highly experienced Multimedia/Web guy, let me know. My CV is here. I'm also looking for a 6 month internship for February - July of 2003. Will code, design, write, upload, download, dance for food (okay, not dance).

That is all. Redesign on the way...eventually; I'm slightly busy.
