Okay, I've taken down the slightly weird holder image, and I've started working on the new site. I'm going to be building it gradually over the next month or so, adding and testing the functional elements as I go along, and then integrating the full design towards the end. Don't expect this to be pretty (or quick)....but at least it's a start.
