It seems as though there are now two Underground webrings in operation, the original one that hasn't been doing much lately, and the new one by Brent Ritchey. I think it'd be better if there was just one webring, there really isn't any need for two. For now, you can use wither on this site, but once thins is all sorted out, hopefully there'll only be one. Strange.
