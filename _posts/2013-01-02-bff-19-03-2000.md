I've added a selection of songs recorded at the December gig in London's Royal Albert Hall. This was probably the band's "biggest" gig ever, with full strings and brass sections, as well as Fleming and John on flugel and vocals...so the songs sound extra good. Thanks to Mike Twaits of the UK Fleming and John page for giving me a copy of his bootleg. Check the songs out (highlighted in green) in the Real Audio Section.
