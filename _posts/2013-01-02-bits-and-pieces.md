Nearly time to go back to college, so preparations are under way. I'm totally broke this year, so I won't have the luxury of new books and equipment like last year so I'll have to make do with the scattering of books in the DCU library.

DCU, my college, are about to open a 36 million Euro arts centre called The Helix. According to the president of the college 

> DCU is committed to delivering excellence in the arts and the humanities as part of its mission to foster creativity and to spearhead change for the benefit of society.

It's a pity that my course, the Bachelor of Science in Multimedia at the same institution has been radically reduced in scale because of budget constraints and poor planning, with nearly 40% of classes being cut and many staff already out of jobs. It seems as though the commitment to the arts and the actual development of new talent isn't as important as the development of landmarks and legacies. We didn't need 36 million either....

I'm working on a new design for the page; CSS, MySQL, PHP, XHTML and many other acronyms will feature...as soon as I learn more of said technologies. Current forecasts suggest that the learning of said technologies will cost less than 36 million Euro.
