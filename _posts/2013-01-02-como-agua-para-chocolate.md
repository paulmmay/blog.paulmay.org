Out with the old, in with the new. The weather station application is finished, the Kubrick cd-rom is finished. Must move on to more Cinema 4D stuff and a Flash project. I'll post the weather programme up on Monday, use it in good health. The new site is on the way; the independent content producer refuses to die...but he's definitely not feeling too well.
