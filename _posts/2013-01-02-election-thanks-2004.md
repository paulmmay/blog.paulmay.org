Last night I was elected as DCU Students' Union President after an election that was long and tiring for all the candidates.

I'd like to thank everybody who helped me along the way, especially Donal Mulligan, Cliona Casserly, Yvonne Tuohy, Eoghan McIlwaine, Jacqui Lynch, Daniel Farrell, Rosie and Sharon, John Lynch, Derek Holland, Ciaran Lennon, Mark Rusk, Kris Clarkin, and everybody from my class and DCU Drama who helped along the way. It's really strange, stressful and difficult to put yourself out there in an election, so I'd like to congratulate all the candidates who put in a huge amount of work.

I'm going to write a better thank you note later, but for now, thanks for voting, and thanks for your support.
