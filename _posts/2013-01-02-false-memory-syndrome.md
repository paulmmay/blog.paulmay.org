It turns out that if you tell yourself something is true for long enough, then it becomes true. That's hardly groundbreaking news, but it's strange when it happens.

All summer long I've been sure, completely sure, that I was flying home on the 21st of September. Down to the last detail of handing the keys back to my landlord, leaving work, doing tourist stuff around Chicago, it's all been planned around this magical date of the 21st of September....a date that I apparently invented at some stage in the last 4-6 months. I happened to be checking my tickets yesterday (the 17th), and I saw that I was actually supposed to fly home on the 18th....less than 24 hours away. The idea of basically packing, getting up and then going to the airport wasn't exactly the way I pictured my farewell to Chicago. It takes time to say goodbye to a whole city and to all of its occupants you've come to know. I managed to change my flight to the magical, invented date of the 21st of September, so I now have a few days to do the things I had planned.

I can imagine opening my tickets on the Saturday at the airport, realising that my flight left 4 days earlier...that would have been fun, and expensive.

It's strange to think how real something can become when you tell yourself that it's true, and embellish it with details, plans, significance. I wonder what other soothing lies I've been telling myself. Who knows!
