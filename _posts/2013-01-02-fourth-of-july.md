Happy 4th of July from Chicago! It's Independence Day here in the U.S., so there's a lot of fireworks and barbecues happening. Despite the news reports of tightened security and heightened tension, the mood here is very relaxed and normal. We watched the fireworks last night from the shore of the lake, which was cool.

I'm doing well, and still job hunting. If you're a prospective employer, and you're reading this, then please please hire me...I'm good :)
