My friends and former employers at Fever Interactive have decided to cease trading...as we all know, the web business isn't the exciting and lucrative place it used to be.

I'd like to thank them for three great years, and for teaching me so much. It's a pity that a talented group of people didn't manage to survive, but I'm sure they're all going to go on to be hugely successful in their future careers. Good luck for the future to all of them.
