It's a beautiful day today in Chicago, the 6th of August. As I was walking home this morning, on a picture perfect day, the strangest thing happened. I don't know what it's like in other towns and cities, but here in Chicago they have these huge sirens on the top of telegraph poles. They're a hangover from the cold war, designed to alert the public of nuclear attack. Anyway, they're tested every now and again, the US is, after all, still a nuclear power. So, as I'm walking on this perfect day, the huge siren 2 blocks away from me starts to wail. It's a strange sound, a classic, howling air raid siren. The perfect morning interrupted by this relic from another time.

It's the 6th of August, 1945. The first nuclear bomb ever used in anger floats gently downwards from the bomber towards the industrial city of Hiroshima. From the bomber, the explosion looks like a brilliant sunrise over the city, silent, beautiful; the clouds over the city evaporating in a pink haze as the blast wave thumps the back of the aircraft. 75,000 people on the ground are already dead, and in the following months and years, thousands more will die of injuries and poisoning.

You can imagine my surprise when I heard the siren today.
