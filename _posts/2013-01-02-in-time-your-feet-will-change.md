The working life continues here in Chicago. I'm really enjoying my new job, not because it's all that interesting, exciting, challenging...but because I'm finally doing what I came here to do; meeting new people and making enough money to have a good time. Hey, I even have enough money to get some photos developed, so I'll post them up next week, Tuesday maybe. I went to a party last night at the Irish lads' house here in Hyde Park. It was a funny mix of work faces and other lost Irish souls. It was of course, very very drunk :)

Anyway, that's the news that's new and improved. It's time now for a post party swim in the crystal waters of Lake Michigan.
