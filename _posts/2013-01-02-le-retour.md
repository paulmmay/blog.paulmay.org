I'm back in Chicago now after an amazing week in San Francisco. The entire week was incredible; Alcatraz, The Golden Gate, Chinatown, everything! San Francisco is a really fun city, and I definitely want to visit there for longer in the future. I have 5 rolls of film to develop, and when they're done I'll post up some of them. For now, it's time for bed....I'm tired!
