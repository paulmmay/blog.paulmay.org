Got some photos back yesterday, so I'll post up two or three later on in the photos section. I'm running out of time in the US, so I'll have to start taking lots of pictures. Surprisingly enough I've only taken two rolls of film since I got here....and I usually take about one roll a week when I'm at home, so I've a lot of catching up to do. In the next few days I'll be going to see the dubious phenomenon that is the Jerry Springer show, and then I'm off to San Francisco for a while. More later.
