I suppose I should say something about Prolix! Eight of us in MMA2 have decided to run for Students' Union President, under the collective name Prolix. We're running to liven up the elections, to have a laugh, and to contrast last year's one candidate "race"...but mostly just have a laugh. You've probably seen our tastefully designed posters around the college. They don't say much, but we enjoy their mysterious vagueness. We're offering a safe, hopeless alternative to the people who actually want to win :) So, get out and vote, vote for anybody....just vote.
