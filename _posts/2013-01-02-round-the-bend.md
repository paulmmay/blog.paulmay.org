I feel the need to write. I'm in the death throes of my Weather Station application, which allows the user to get real-time weather data from 7000 stations world wide. It nearly works....nearly. Anyway, when the programme is finished you'll be able to download it here, so stay tuned.

Some day I will leave this room...
