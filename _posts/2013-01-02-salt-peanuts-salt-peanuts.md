It's nearly pay day! We get paid bi-monthly, which is a bit tough, but I'm expecting a pretty decent cheque this thursday. I paid my rent today, which was was usual, exciting and fulfilling beyond words.

So, with my ill gotten gains I am planning a trip out West to the sunny land of California. I'm going to book a flight to San Francisco in the next day or three, I just have to decide when I want to go. It'll probably be a week in August. I'm trying to get my rent for September together before I splurge on the ticket, but hopefully I'll be in a fairly comfortable position by my second pay cheque, which is due on the 16th of August. I can't wait! It's going to be fun! When I get home to Ireland I can at least say that I've visited both coasts, South Carolina and San Francisco. For all of you in San Francisco, I am on my way. Prepare.
