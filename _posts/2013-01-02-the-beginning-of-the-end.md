It's January. In six months time we will leave New York bound for who-knows-where. I have become deeply attached to this city, to my friends who live here, to the seemingly infinite possibility of the place. The J Visa is a cruel mistress - you come for a while then you go for a while.

All we can do is try to make every day count and thank our lucky stars that we got the chance to be here, even for a short while.
