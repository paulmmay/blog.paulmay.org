We've moved from Berkeley to San Francisco, "The City". We're staying in an amazing area, literally yards from City Lights, the offices of American Zoetrope; the film company of Francis Ford Coppola. The area is right on the fringes of Chinatown and Northbeach, so it's really buzzing.

San Francisco is a strange place, it almost feels like a European city in places, and then like a city in China in other places, its size and climate really don't feel very American at all. It's a nice contrast to the larger than life Chicago.

The itinerary for the next few days is taking shape. Tonight we're going to see Queens of the Stone-age, tomorrow Therese is arriving from Boston, Wednesday we're going to see Sonic Youth, Thursday is a night tour of Alcatraz, and then Friday is either an Oakland A's or SF Giants baseball game...so we're going to be busy. In between all of that we're mooching around Chinatown and Northbeach, trying to soak in as much as we can in the short amount of time we have here.

Gotta run, more soon.
