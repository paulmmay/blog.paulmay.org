I'm well and truly down to earth after San Francisco now, work yesterday saw to that. My job is so cripplingly dull that sometimes I feel like I can't breathe. But whatever, I clock in, stand around for a while, talk to some people, clock out, repeat. I actually only have about 10 days left in work, which is probably all I could handle. I shudder to think what it must be like for the poor souls who have been there for years.

Today I shall eat breakfast, the first one I've eaten in a while. Eggs will be prepared, scrambled eggs, and possibly cereal. Tea will undoubtedly accompany breakfast. Tea, eggs, cereal; breakfast.

I will do <a href="http://www.jetprogramme.org">this</a>...some day.
