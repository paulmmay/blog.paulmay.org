As promised, here is the shockwave version of the weather application I finished recently. This buggy and frankly ugly version of the app is pretty fragile, as the programme was made for use as a standalone desktop app, and not a shockwave app. In other words....if this breaks, please get in touch with me. The full version, which I'll post in a day or two allows you to enter a weather station (ICAO) code and retrieve the weather that way. You will of course need the Shockwave Plugin. Full working versions of the programme will be available in a day or so.
