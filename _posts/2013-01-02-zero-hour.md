One more week to go in Chicago, so there's no time to lose. Activities for the next week will probably include a Sox game, a final trip to Margie's Candies, the Museum of Science and Industry, The Art Institute of Chicago, The Museum of Contemporary Art, drinking my body weight at Rose's Bar and many more educational activities.

Today I will spend more money that I should be saving on either a book or getting photos developed. I may be flying home hungry.
