Friends, the end of an era is upon us. I'm just confirming what you all probably know; that this page will go into permanent deep freeze as of today. I just don't have the time to add to the Armchair page, or to answer all the e-mail I get, so I'm going to end on a high note, and quit while the page is still in good shape. I love you all, and I want to thank you for allowing me to continue with the page for so long. You have all given me so much, more than you know. I will always remember the kind people I've met along the way...we've had some great years. Goodbye my friends....it's been fun.
