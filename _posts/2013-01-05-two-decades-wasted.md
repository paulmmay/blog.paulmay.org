What I find most disappointing about the recent statements from <a href="http://www.nni.ie/v2/broad/portal.php?content=../_includes/prportal.php&date=4th%20Jan%202013&year=2013">National Newspapers of Ireland</a> isn't that they continue to assert that linking to a website could possibly constitute copyright infringement and/or require licensing - that old chestnut is as old as the web itself. 

What is most disappointing is that it demonstrates that the NNI and the newspapers it represents have done very little to understand the unique opportunities that the web offers to them in the two decades since the web became broadly available in Ireland. What we've seen in the last few weeks from NNI is old thinking, an entrenched mindset that can't consider the value of content unbundled from a physical medium or an insular website. If hyperlinks are beyond their ken, what about complex economic issues, data-driven journalism, APIs, mobile computing, video, audio, strategic partnerships? 

I contend that two decades is adequate time for any industry to hone the critical faculties, business models and skills made relevant by new technologies. Let the newspapers that NNI represents keep pace with Irish people and contemporary society or let them die. No more holding back the seas.
