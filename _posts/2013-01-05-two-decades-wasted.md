What I find most disappointing about the recent statements from <a href="http://www.nni.ie/v2/broad/portal.php?content=../_includes/prportal.php&date=4th%20Jan%202013&year=2013">National Newspapers of Ireland</a> isn't that they assert that linking to a website could require licensing - that old chestnut is as old as the web itself. What is most disappointing is that it's a clear sign that the Irish news media have done very little to prepare for the opportunities that the web now offers them.

What we've seen in the last few weeks from NNI is old thinking -  an entrenched mindset that can't consider the value of content unbundled from a physical medium or an insular website. If hyperlinks are beyond the Irish news media's ken, what about complex economic issues, data-driven journalism, mobile computing, video journalism, blogging?

I contend that two decades is adequate time for any industry to hone the critical faculties, business models and skills made relevant by new technologies. Similarly, if you're a journalist and your skillset hasn't expanded to include an understanding of copyright, mass-participation in media production, ethics in the digital age, data analysis and online publishing then your window of relevance is probably going to be limited. 

Let the newspapers that NNI represents keep pace with Irish people and contemporary society or let them die. No more holding back the seas.
