I'm excited to see Shane Carruth's new film, <a href="http://www.shanecarruth.com/film/upstreamcolor">Upstream Color</a>. Carruth is the writer and director of one of my favourite films, <a href="http://www.shanecarruth/film/primer">Primer</a>. Made on a shoestring budget and released in 2004, Primer updates a well-worn mainstay of science fiction storytelling, the "time-machines are probably a bad idea" tale. The film's major innovation was to show, in ambitious detail, the practical and emotional burdens of time travel.

As life for the two protagonists divides into a tangle of recursive, competing timelines we're asked to consider how complicated things would get if more people had access to the time machine. Like all time-machine stories, Primer is a moral fable about the limits of human imagination and the hazard of acting purely in self interest. It's an energetic, rich, and very rewarding film. 

My hope is that Upstream Color comes close to being as entertaining as Primer. The press notes and trailer for the film are compelling in their vagueness:

> A man and woman are drawn together, entangled in the lifecycle of an ageless organism. Identity becomes an illusion as they struggle to assemble the loose fragments of wrecked lives.

Upstream Color will be shown at the <a href="http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13010/upstream_color">Sundance Film Festival</a> next week before going on limited/guerrilla release in April.
