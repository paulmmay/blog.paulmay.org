New York City has issued a design challenge called [Reinvent Payphones](http://www.reinventpayphones.splashthat.com/) and has asked designers to think of new uses for the city's payphone infrastructure. I went along to the information session last night and was pretty disheartened. I just don't think that the approach being taken by the city will result in a good outcome for the city, or the designers who take part.

There is no clear statement of why the City needs or wants to reinvent payones, other than the expiration of the current commercial payphone contracts. The City can't offer any useful data about payphone usage, the role that the phones play in the life of the city, or the changing context. They give [a list of things that are important](http://www.reinventpayphones.splashthat.com/#nyc_nav), but don't say which things are more important than others. The brief is too just too broad to be useful.
 
If the City was really invested in the outcome of the challenge then more care and attention should have been put into writing the brief; describing the context, offering useful data, stating a problem, setting clear goals - and then being flexible about the form of the solution (maybe a reinvented payphone isn't a reinvented payphone). 

Next, there are the rules. Even though designers are encouraged to design and build prototypes, they will receive no compensation for their time or materials. They automatically give the city a free, perptetual license to use their work. A commercial procurement process for the development of a new payphone system will be run "completely separately". But, the City acknowledges that designers' ideas might be incorporated into that process. How is this fair?

Between the very poorly-stated brief and the strange terms, Reinvent Payphones seems to boil down to the City using members of the design community to flesh out the requirements of a commerical contract, in return for some praise and publicity. 

To me, this falls into the category of uncompensated design, or spec work, and it's disheartening to see a City like New York trawling for spec work. Here are just a few of my reasons why challenges like this are bad:

1. Uncompensated design challenges are exploitative. When a company or organization with the wherewithal to offer compensation asks a designer to solve a problem and then give the solution to them for free, that is exploitative. Just because the organization arranges for the person to be praised in public for being such a good sport is irrelevant. Publicity is gratifying but it doesn't put food on the table.
2. Uncompensated design challenges reward the wrong thing. Is the design that gains the widest publicity the best design? Of course not. It's just the one optimized for maximum public acceptance. 
3. Uncompensated design challenges are elitist. Uncompensated design challenges exclude people who have the most to gain from good design from the design process. The underserved and disadvantaged can't gamble their time on the promise of good vibes the possibility of a paying job down the road. 

If we take these few problems and run them over time, what do we get? We get a lot of designers doing work but only some living with dignity. We get a class of "successful" designers who live apart from the people who really need the products of good design. We get a design culture where people who shape reputations hold far more power than the people we design for. We optimise for designs that are "right" because they find favour. We separate designers from the context and the client and expect them to just riff on ideas, as though that's the same thing as design.

I am not alone. Universities and professional associations urge caution around design challenges and spec work:

> [The School of Design at Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.design.cmu.edu/files/school_of_design_position_on_solicitations_for_competitions.pdf):  We discourage proposals for competitions because they are usually a solicitation of design concepts to be produced on a speculative basis by the professionals you are considering. We do not participate in, or promote projects that essentially ask students to design on 'spec'.

> [AIGA](http://www.aiga.org/position-spec-work/) believes that professional designers should be compensated fairly for their work and should negotiate the ownership or use rights of their intellectual and creative property through an engagement with clients. To that end, AIGA strongly encourages designers to enter into client projects with full engagement to show the value of their creative endeavor, and to be aware of all potential risks before entering into speculative work.

I know that New York City can do better than this. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts on uncompensated design challenges, and ways of encouraging participation and collaboration without exploitation.
