[The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/) is a wonderful creative programming class taught at ITP by [Dan Shiffman](http://www.shiffman.net/). In The Nature of Code, students learn how to programme software applications that mimic nature in some way, covering topics like gravity, wind, flocking, learning and evolution. For my own final project I made [a little simulation](https://vimeo.com/41397044) where creatures are born, flock, find food, react to danger, age and die.

The class was a real revelation for me. I wasn't good at maths or physics in school, and only really started to grasp concepts like trigonometry, vectors and forces in Dan's class. I really wish that a class like this (and more creative methods of teaching) had been available when I was much younger.

Dan has just [released a book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0985930802/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0985930802&linkCode=as2&tag=natureofcode-20) that covers, and expands upon, the content of the class. There's a freely available [library of code](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples) and Dan is [recording a series of (highly entertaining) videos](https://vimeo.com/channels/464686) to help students along. 

I can't recommend Nature of Code highly enough. Enjoy the class, and help this great content finds its way to people teaching maths, physics, biology, or computing to young people.
