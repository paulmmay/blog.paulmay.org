In the latest episode of the excellent [Philosophy Bites](http://philosophybites.com/2013/01/tom-sorell-on-surveillance.html) podcast, philosopher Tom Sorell eloquently describes why surveillance-free spaces are important. Sorell is taking part in the [Surveille project](http://www.surveille.eu/) that is examining the usage and ethics of surveillance in Europe.

> If one has to answer the question "what in general makes privacy valuable?" it may be that you need privacy in order to be an autonomous person. 

> Even to be you, you need a space of autonomous reflection, otherwise you might become the mouthpiece for the people around you. If you're never able to have this space that's afforded by the private mind, you just become a mouthpiece for the official view, or the views of your parents, or the views of your friendship group. You need a space in which you're able to put your own stamp on your beliefs, and that means coming up with reasons for them from your own point of view.

I don't agree with everything Sorell says (I *do* believe that the use of surveillance necessarily involves a power relationship), but it's an important conversation to have, especially given the ubiquity of social software, connected cameras, and rapidly shifting norms around what constitutes public and private space. It's good to see the EU funding work like this.
