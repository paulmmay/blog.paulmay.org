It's been a very positive first full week in London. 

Even though we've left New York, I'm going to continue working with Sloan-Kettering from London. I am really delighted about that. My working day in London overlaps with New York by about 4 hours, which is perfect - lots of time for us to collaborate, then lots of time for heads-down work. 

Over the the coming year my focus will be on desinging experiences/agents (nimble little products) that use some of the wonderful knowledge available at MSKCC to help the hospital plan for the future, and make good day-to-day decisions.

This week I've just been getting set up. I've moved into a very nice co-working space in Hackney, and have been getting my desk and micro-office set up. The space overlooks the site of the 2012 Olympic Games, which is currently being redeveloped as a public park.

Next week, I'll finish getting set up. Then, it'll be down to real work.

### Quickies
* I invested in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), a fabulous text editor. 
* I bought [this monitor](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005QVZ79C/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for my desk.
* I have started using [Instagram](http://instagram.com/paulmayorg/), despite my queasiness about their terms and conditions. My real photos will still be uploaded to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/). 
* I am taking [this class](https://class.coursera.org/matrix-001/) on linear algebra. So far, it's not much fun.  
* I am 60% of the way through 1Q84.
* I have still not scanned any of the photos I took in May or June.
