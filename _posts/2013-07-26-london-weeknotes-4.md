This week has been pretty good. 

On Saturday/Sunday I completed the Dunwich Dynamo; an overnight bike ride from London to Suffolk. I covered just over 175Km in about 7 hours 30 minutes. 

The first 75Km out of London were refreshing - some stopping and starting, roundabouts, and a few gentle rises to wake up the legs. I was glad to reach the rest stop just after midnight. I took on water and had some very decent food, provided by volunteers.

With the sun completely gone, but with a bright moon to give a bit of a glow to the roads, I got into a group of cyclists from 75Km to 130km and made good time in their train. It is somewhat surreal to barrel along on quiet country roads in the dead of night, following a trail of blinking red lights that stretches off into the gloom. Just the sound of wheels on the road, and the click-click of my freewheel.

I got a little lost between 130Km and 150Km. Thankfully two other cyclists also took the wrong turn, and one of them knew how to get back to the main route. We got back in contact, and settled into the last 20-30Km. A slog. I was tired, and my legs were starting to tighten.

When I made it to Dunwich beach just after 5am I had a couple of cups of tea, a bar of chocolate, a protein drink. Some people got in for a swim.  I just had a nice sit down. The bus back to London left just after 9am. At home, I ate lunch, had a shower, and proceeded to pass out for several hours. 

The Dynamo was definitely the highlight of the week, and I'll do it again next year. 

In other news, my work is challenging at the moment - in good ways and bad. Cliona is searching and interviewing for jobs. She is making great progress. 

The first full month in London has flown by. 

### Quickies
* I am falling behind in the linear algebra class, and thinking of shelving it for now. I've already learned a lot, and I can come back to it on my own time, or the next time the online class is run.
* I finished 1Q84. It's definitely the least coherent and most conventional Murakami book that I've read. Whole sections feel repititious. There's a sort of sappy misogyny about the plot. The resolution feels like an unconvincing magic trick. It's his worst book to date in my opinion. 
* What should I read next?
