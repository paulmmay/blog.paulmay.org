A busy week, a tiring week. While Cliona was settling into her new job, I stayed in London to tidy a few things up. 

Yesterday I moved out of the co-working space in Hackney Wick, rented a little van, and drove our stuff up to Oxford. Our little house there is the bees' knees, and I'm looking forward to getting settled.

Today, I'm back in London to lock up our sublet in Hackney. Tomorrow morning I fly to the US. I am staying with Simon and Amy in Allentown for a couple of days, then I'll be in New York to see the good people at Sloan-Kettering.

Obituaries; not to become a regular feature.

This week we lost the founder of ITP, [Red Burns](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/nyregion/red-burns-godmother-of-silicon-alley-dies-at-88.html). The reaction to her death on the ITP Alumni mailing list has been quite intense. Some people loved Red. Some really didn't. I think there is a consensus that she was a hardworking, whip-smart, opinionated, and uncompromising woman. 

We also lost [Seamus Heaney](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13930435). At school we read and studied him, but I didn't hear him. Today, for the first time, I feel like I heard him.
