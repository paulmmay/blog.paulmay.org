An addendum to [Everywhere I Have Ever Lived](/blog/everywhere-i-have-ever-lived):

Having [left New York](/blog/goodbye-for-now-new-york) in the Summer of 2013, we move to London - maybe temporarily, maybe not - while Cliona looked for a new job. I am flexible, and continue to work on projects with Sloan-Kettering from a co-working space in Hackney Wick. 

We sublet a cute little apartment fom [Maria Zahle](http://www.arcadefinearts.com/artists'%20pages/mariazahle.html). It's our happy Hackney home for two months before Cliona finds a job in Oxford, and we opt to move up there.

I will miss Hackney quite a bit, but we move forward.
