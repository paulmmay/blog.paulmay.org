What an amazing week. I've been in the US since Saturday. 

I spent the weekend with Simon, Amy, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/7916834928/">Trotsky</a> in Allentown, which was lovely. We ate great food, watched Total Recall *and* Predator. Super chilled and fun times. 

On Monday, me and Simon took part in a 36-mile bike race, the Donut Derby. In the Derby, racers have 3 minutes deducted off their time for [every donut eaten](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_qhfpUmZ6R-c/TJBMl7tCk8I/AAAAAAAACzM/loE08IokCEQ/s1600-h/DSCN1439%5B5%5D.jpg) at the rest stops. 

Me and Simon managed a total of 6 donuts each. We then managed to get lost - adding 5 miles onto our race, and wiping out both our donut-adjusted time, and our chances of finishing in the respectable half of the field. Next year I am going to pay closer attention to the road markings, bring a GPS device, and eat more donuts. It was still a great ride, and was actually the first time me and Simon have been on bikes together since we were kids.

On Tuesday I relocated to New York, and spent the working week meeting with the folks at MSKCC. In the evenings I got to spend time with my [super-amazing NYC friends](http://fredtruman.com/spring-2011-show-photo)	, eat [ice-cream sandwiches](http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2008/06/new-york-citys-top-10-best-ice-cream-sandwiches-nyc.html), [eat delicious bagels](http://www.oldebrooklynbagelshop.com/), [eat more donuts](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dough-brooklyn), go to [the theatre](http://www.armoryonpark.org/programs_events/detail/the_machine), and see [some great live music](http://www.pianosnyc.com/upstairs). The whole week was like a highlights reel of everything I love about New York. I didn't get to see everybody I'd like to see, but I hope to be back soon. Special thanks to Ross and Natalie for letting me stay with them for a couple of nights. 

I'm at Newark airport now, heading to Dublin via London. Tomorrow I get to see my family and my Dublin friends, attend Kevin Cannon's birthday, and see Verona Riots in concert. 

I'll be back at home in Oxford on Sunday night. Maybe on Monday I will not get on a plane, or cross a border. 

Life is good at the moment.
