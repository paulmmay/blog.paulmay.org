Last week I had the pleasure of attending some of the final student presentations and [end-of-year show](http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp13/courses/final-projects-2013/) at the [Copenhagen Institute for Interaction Design](http://www.ciid.dk). Here are some of my favourite projects:

I also really liked:

* [hej_verden](http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp13/courses/final-projects-2013/hej_verden/) - A toolkit to help children learn computer programming.
* [Little Treasures](http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp13/courses/final-projects-2013/little-treasures/) - A thoroughly-designed service designed to teach children about the concept of value and the use of money. 
* [Hand Made](http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp13/courses/final-projects-2013/hand-made/) - An exploration of human hand gestures, and a platform to collect novel hand gestures. 

The work from CIID students was, as ever, thorough and thoughtful. It's a great programme.
