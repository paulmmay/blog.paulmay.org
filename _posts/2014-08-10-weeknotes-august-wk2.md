It's feen a fun week. I raced [my first triathlon in 5 years](/blog/london-triathlon-2014-race-notes) last weekend. As this was my only priority race for the year (I'll maybe do one other triathlon before focusing on winter training), I've allowed myself a week of rest, eating anything I want, doing whatever. It's been nice. I've gained just over 1Kg in a week, which is hilarious and terrifying. 

I took the time that I would have spent training fixing up my blog a little. I wanted to try some new typography, and a more flexible structure. The paint is still wet, but I am excited to be rummaging around and trying some new things. I get to prototype things at work quite a bit, but it's nice to work on my own little place on the web, even if I only have time to make something very simple.

Cliona is doing great. We are now just 10 weeks away from the birth of our first child. We don't know if it's going to be a boy or a girl, and as such, haven't decided on a name, or even a shortlist of names. We'll probably think more about that over the next few weeks. What's certain is that the baby is kicking and wriggling around like it can't wait for the transition to land-mode. 

My sister-in-law, Michelle, got engaged to her boyfriend Kevin today. My sister-sister, Louise, has started sending out invitations to her own wedding in October. It's all very lovely.

Work is going well. My team is really working hard, and solving some very challenging problems. We need more people; so if you're a software engineer, interaction designer, or otherwise good at building things for the web, please get in touch. 

The weather here has started to turn a little chillier, a little gloomier. I want to wring what's left out of the summer, so this week I'd like to spend some time out on the bike. Hopefully the weather cooperates.
