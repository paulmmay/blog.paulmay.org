    <h1>New Site, Now with Comments and RSS</h1>

    <p>After a summer and fall of slowly rewriting this site in Ruby on Rails I realized that a Rails app is overkill. That and that I actually prefer the command line and text editor to any web form.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>It's a static site generator written in Ruby. No database. No browser interface. I write my posts in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and have a handful of template files. Running Jekyll (<code>$ jekyll</code>) combines the templates with the posts and generates html files of the site. Very little server load, simple. Easy to update. No bloat or complicated (and largely unneeded) Wordpress upgrades.</p>

<p>However I've been disappointed with the lack of detailed documentation for setting up Jekyll. I'll write a bit here how I set up comments and an RSS feed and soon I'll write up creating and deploying a site with Jekyll.</p>

<h2>Comments with Disqus</h2>

<p>For commenting, without a database, I had to look for a service that could embed in the page and save the comments on an external database. Embeddable commenting is exactly what <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> does. Getting Disqus on my site was wonderfully easy and straight forward. I found a tutorial by Douglas Creager who explains the whole process on <a href="http://dcreager.net/2009/08/07/disqus-comments/">his own Jekyll site</a>. So I've got Disqus comments, just like over on my <a href="http://stevenklise.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, so please use it.</p>

<h2>Burning an RSS Feed</h2>

<p>Even though Google Reader has just crippled itself I still prefer to digest the internet through RSS feeds. With Jekyll's templating building a feed was also easy and took 5 minutes to set up. Five minutes if you remove the time spent chasing character encoding issues from copying posts from Wordpress. I found a <a href="http://recursive-design.com/blog/2010/09/14/integrating-jekyll-with-feedburner/">tutorial</a> from Recursive Design to create a feed and then the one step process of getting that feed hosted on Feedburner.</p>

<p>Straightforward until the author started talking about nginx rewrites. There is some code offered to make a rewrite but no indication where that code goes. If you're familiar with nginx you probably knew exactly how to do this, but I don't. This site is hosted on Heroku so a rewrite would not be able to be applied directly to the server and would have to be app specific. Jekyll on Heroku requires the <code>rack-jekyll</code> gem (<a href="https://github.com/bry4n/rack-jekyll">documentation on Github</a>). Running on Rack gives quick access to rewrites in just four lines. Open up <code>config.ru</code> (a full tutorial on Jekyll is coming soon, on this blog) and add the following lines:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1340812.js?file=config.ru"></script>


<p>You'll also need to include <code>rack/rewrite</code> in your <code>Gemfile</code> or <code>.gems</code>. I went with bundler and a <code>Gemfile</code> which you can see below</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1340812.js?file=Gemfile"></script>


<p>So far, blogging with Jekyll has been great.</p>
