<p>Oh, cool. You just got a new Mac. And now you want to install all the best programs don't you? Here's my list of core apps with brief descriptions of what makes them so amazing. Also, a section on what default settings I like to adjust to smooth out my computing experience.</p>

<h3>Menu Bar</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/">Flux</a> warms up the color temperature of your screen after sunset. The bright blue tones turn to muted reds and oranges as you keep coding late in to the night.</li>
<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caffeine/id411246225?mt=12">Caffeine</a> disables your screensaver and keeps the screen awake, very handy as you read long articles or watch videos that don't go full screen. I do wish their icon did a bit more to blend in with all-black system style.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>. You should already know about this program. One nice trick is to open Dropbox preferences and select "Use black and white menu bar icons" to get rid of the obnoxious blue icon.</li>
<li><p>CalendarBar</p></li>
<li><p>SizeUp</p></li>
<li>iA Writer</li>
<li>Marked</li>
<li>Growl</li>
<li>Alfred</li>
</ul>


<h3>Code</h3>

<ul>
<li>TextWrangler</li>
<li>GitX</li>
<li>Sequel Pro</li>
<li>Transmit</li>
</ul>
