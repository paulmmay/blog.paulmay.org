<p>I'm presenting Floorsquare at the ITP Winter Show.</p>

<p><img src="http://sklise.s3.amazonaws.com/itp/floorsquare_winter_2011.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The project is an interactive directory of the students and faculty currently on the floor at ITP. It's purpose is to give a glimpse at what is going on around the floor as you first enter. What projects are being presented? Who is around offering help in certain subjects.</p>

<p>Checking in to Floorsquare currently requires an NYU ID card. The app also serves as an open API for other student projects wishing to access student directory information.</p>

<p>Floorsquare is a group project with Jeremy Scott Diamond, Zach Schwartz, Lily Szajnberg, Noah Crowley, Meghan Hoke, Gabby Levine, Greg Dorsainville &amp; Matt Tennie.</p>
