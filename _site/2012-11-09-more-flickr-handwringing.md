I wrote this as a comment on <a href="http://stewf.tumblr.com/post/35334085915/flickr-is-dead-long-live-flickr">Stephen Coles' article</a> about Flickr and thought it was probably worth snipping and keeping; maybe even expanding upon some time. The crux of Stephen's original article is this paragraph:\

\cf0 Flickr is certainly not the all-purpose photography social network it once was. There is no doubt Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and other more immediate, accessible, and \'97 most importantly \'97 mobile-savvy venues took that position. But Flickr is still a haven for professional photography, and for the visual documentation of specialized fields, because nothing is better for tagging, archiving, organizing, research, collaborating, curating, and finding others who share your particular interest. \

I see what you're saying, but Flickr is not commercially viable as a place for "professional photographers" (whatever that means anymore). It needs the blend of subscription revenue, mass-participation, exposure to advertising and experimentation that have supported it since it launched. It needs that long tail of people who are trying it out and who might become a subscriber. It needs the huge percentage of people who might upload dozens or hundreds of photos, but look at thousands. \
\
Flickr has always done a good job of focussing on doing a limited number of things really well; sharing, interoperability (its API), privacy, tagging, annotating photographs, the Commons - they designed the state of the art for much of what we take for granted in media sharing on the web. \
\
Flickr hasn't responded in any way to the growth of mobile photography - the most significant thing to happen to casual snapping, reportage photography and the aesthetic of photography in decades. The mobile applications it has released have done little more than damage its brand.\
\
Since Heather Champ departed Flickr efforts to foster and understand the Flickr community have really withered on the vine. They've lost other, similarly talented folks in design, engineering - these people have found homes in start-ups and more dynamic online services. \
\
I could go on. \
\
Flickr is becoming a storage device and a community of people who regard themselves as being above the churning sea of content being produced by everyday photographers. It was never designed to be either. The subscription cost is cheap for the value that Flickr offers in isolation, but seemingly expensive when compared to other services. \
\
Flickr has lost its way - it's in the expensive mainframe business when the world is buying desktops; it panders to an idealised customer as the actual customer moves on. \
\
Having said all of that, it could come back, it has the potential to come back - but not without taking a good look at how photography actually exists in people's lives today, not what an elite think photography should be - then designing for those needs. It's an exciting prospect, they can do it; I very much hope they do - but time is running out.\

Stephen has <a href="http://stewf.tumblr.com/post/35334085915/flickr-is-dead-long-live-flickr">replied to my comment</a>, he has some good points:\

\cf0 I agree that Flickr has modernizing work to do, but I reject the increasingly common assertion that a platform must cater to the lowest common denominator in order to be relevant or successful. There is room on the web for outfits who do certain things very well and leave the rest to others.\

\cf0 But here's where we disagree. I look at the photos being snapped by people on their phones and am blown away. I want as many people as possible to take photos, to understand the medium, to really get visual culture. I think Flickr is a great platform for opening up all of that great content and experience to people. I don't see mass participation as lowest common denominator - I see it as an exciting laboratory of culture from which professional photographers have more to lean than fear.\

\cf0 As for whether a service like Flickr needs to be all things to all people - I hear what you're saying, but Flickr was set up to afford particular great things, like sharing - rather than to afford particular groups of people who knew a lot about photography. The fact that the community is becoming less diverse, and pro photographers still find the experience satisfying isn't a surprise. That more serious photographers enjoy feeling like they have an entire web service to themselves now is not surprising - everybody loves a clubhouse.\

\cf0 Photography is the masses' answer to oil painting; and people who have spent a lot of money on cameras feel like it needs to be oil painting again.\

\cf0 If Flickr can tweak itself, just a bit, so that it reflects camera culture as it exists today then it will be a stronger service, a service more likely to survive financially, pro photographers will have something to learn from and teach to. It's when you get these collisions that you get exciting stuff. The alternative is stagnation and comfort; that's not photography.\
