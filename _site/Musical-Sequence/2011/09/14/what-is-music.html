        <p><strong>A response to the first chapter of <em>This Is Your Brain On Music</em> by Daniel J. Levitin.</strong></p>

<p>At age 25, 10 years of which were spent learning piano and saxophone, and most of the rest listening to music I had heard many of the terms defined in the first few pages of <em>What Is Music?</em> but knew them more as vague notions and emotions than technical definitions. The most surprising bit was that pitch and loudness are wholly mental constructs. I had always thought of pitch and loudness as pitch and loudness and that is just how it is.</p>

<p>I had casually wondered how different instruments generated different sounds when playing identical notes. It wasn’t a matter of the frequency so what could it be? I’m trying to wrap my head around overtones. It is still unclear if overtones are a finite set of frequencies or if they exude from the fundamental tone upwards forever. Is there any reason the overtones aren’t undertones?</p>

<p>Shapes of graphs instantly popped in to my head while reading that varying loudnesses of overtones influence the timbre of a sound. Could it be possible to make a morphable graph to create any sound desired? Of course this is a synthesizer, but I really want to create a program that allows the user to draw the shape of the overtones and click and drag at individual points as a experimentation for the shape that sounds from instruments create.</p>

<p>The section describing the tonal system and fractions and differences between keys and how if a piece is written in C but the note distribution is more like A… I got lost on this. Reading about it was not very enlightening without being able to the scales out with a real instrument. So I got out a MIDI keyboard and did try to noodle about, and it’s starting to make sense.</p>
