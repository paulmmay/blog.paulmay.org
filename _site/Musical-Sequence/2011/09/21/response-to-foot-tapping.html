        <p><strong>A response to chapter two of This Is Your Brain On Music by Daniel J. Levitin.</strong></p>

<p>This chap­ter was mostly about rhythm, though also loud­ness and key. It was about what makes music music aside from notes and tim­bre.</p>

<p>Much of the sec­tion on rhythm was spent iden­ti­fy­ing rhythm and ex­plain­ing ex­actly what it is which was mostly re­view for me. Lev­itin did men­tion the back­beat which was char­ac­ter­is­tic to rock and roll. I would have liked to read about how dif­fer­ent types of rhythms and me­ters cor­re­spond to dif­fer­ent styles or gen­res of music. Sousa marches are al­most al­ways in 4/4 time as is dance music but the meter in each is dif­fer­ent though I can’t quite char­ac­ter­ize how.</p>

<p>In the first Lev­itin said that loud­ness is a psy­cho­log­i­cal phe­nom­e­non and not a mea­sur­able qual­ity in­her­ent in sound. I didn’t to­tally buy this at first but de­cided that Lev­itin knew what he was say­ing. Then he elab­o­rated on this no­tion say­ing that in­creases in am­pli­tude do not lin­early cor­re­late to per­ceived loud­ness seemed an ar­gu­ment for loud­ness being a men­tal con­struc­tion. But then there is a mea­sur­able way in which am­pli­tude and loud­ness cor­re­spond. Loud­ness then seems to be a nit­pick­ing way of say­ing that peo­ple ex­pe­ri­ence sound dif­fer­ently. If peo­ple ex­pe­ri­ence sound dif­fer­ently is there a way of know­ing how loud­ness will be in­ter­preted by most lis­ten­ers and cre­at­ing music and sound to cater to that au­di­ence?</p>

<p>Com­ing from mostly pro­gram­ming classes last se­mes­ter where every word had a spe­cific mean­ing and usage as well as in­ter­pre­ta­tion it is a bit con­fus­ing to get in to words, de­f­i­n­i­tions and sub­ject ma­te­r­ial that is sub­jec­tive. But what should I ex­pect? Music is ex­pe­ri­en­tial and made for hu­mans not for com­put­ers to un­der­stand.</p>

<p>It was re­as­sur­ing to hear that most every­one ap­prox­i­mates tempo and rhythm with a 4% mar­gin of error, so I’m not en­tirely far off when clap­ping along. As well that the human ear and brain work to­gether to quan­tize the notes of a piece of music. The lit­tle bit of Able­ton Live that I’ve played around with I thought that the quan­ti­za­tion fea­ture was a bit of a cheat for less-than-great com­puter mu­si­cians but if the ear does this as well then maybe it’s al­right for my com­puter to help out my brain.</p>
