        <p><strong>A response to chapter two of This Is Your Brain On Music by Daniel J. Levitin.</strong></p>

<p>This chapter was mostly about rhythm, though also loudness and key. It was about what makes music music aside from notes and timbre.</p>

<p>Much of the section on rhythm was spent identifying rhythm and explaining exactly what it is which was mostly review for me. Levitin did mention the backbeat which was characteristic to rock and roll. I would have liked to read about how different types of rhythms and meters correspond to different styles or genres of music. Sousa marches are almost always in 4/4 time as is dance music but the meter in each is different though I can’t quite characterize how.</p>

<p>In the first Levitin said that loudness is a psychological phenomenon and not a measurable quality inherent in sound. I didn’t totally buy this at first but decided that Levitin knew what he was saying. Then he elaborated on this notion saying that increases in amplitude do not linearly correlate to perceived loudness seemed an argument for loudness being a mental construction. But then there is a measurable way in which amplitude and loudness correspond. Loudness then seems to be a nitpicking way of saying that people experience sound differently. If people experience sound differently is there a way of knowing how loudness will be interpreted by most listeners and creating music and sound to cater to that audience?</p>

<p>Coming from mostly programming classes last semester where every word had a specific meaning and usage as well as interpretation it is a bit confusing to get in to words, definitions and subject material that is subjective. But what should I expect? Music is experiential and made for humans not for computers to understand.</p>

<p>It was reassuring to hear that most everyone approximates tempo and rhythm with a 4% margin of error, so I’m not entirely far off when clapping along. As well that the human ear and brain work together to quantize the notes of a piece of music. The little bit of Ableton Live that I’ve played around with I thought that the quantization feature was a bit of a cheat for less-than-great computer musicians but if the ear does this as well then maybe it’s alright for my computer to help out my brain.</p>

<p>correspond. Loudness then seems to be a nitpicking way of saying that people experience sound differently. If people experience sound differently is there a way of knowing how loudness will be interpreted by most listeners and creating music and sound to cater to that audience?</p>
