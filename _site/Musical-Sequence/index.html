            <p>The midterm assignment for <a href="/Musica-Sequence">Musical Sequence</a> was to build a sequencer using an Arduino. Here are two images of what I built. It's an eight step sequencer currently with a reset button and a reverse mode. No computer is necessary to operate, and there is a 1/8" audio out jack in the back of the box. Video and a more detailed write up are coming.</p>

            <p>The premise of this chapter seems to be that absolute music, or music without words, needs to be compared to something else—such as literature, an organism or wallpaper—in order to be taken seriously. That music must be in reference, be a metaphor to some other medium, seems to me unreasonable. Is the same demanded of the other art forms? Looking at music in terms of other media can only highlight differences, such as the existence of repetition, but not really address music as a form itself.</p>

<p>Kivy does allow that absolute music is art, is a great creation even though much of the essay seems intent on trivializing absolute music through forcing a comparison. If the literature and organism theories fail due to the repetition of absolute music, what of music with vocals? Are there similar theories for vocal music? If not why not? If the existence of repetition in absolute music makes creates a difficulty this same difficulty should exist in lyrical music yet this is not addressed in the essay.</p>

<p>The above aside, Kivy makes a good argument for the wallpaper theory. Wallpaper and Persian rugs and music share repetition and the repetition is key to the work and not simply a space filler or lack of original thought. The notion that in a repeated pattern each repetition is slightly different than the one before or after due exactly to the temporal relations is, it seems, obvious. Yet though it is obvious there is probably some value to stating and describing the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the essay Kivy says that emotion and feeling are inherent to music, are aroused in the listener by the music. This is different than <em>This Is Your Brain On Music</em> where the emotional quality of music is cultural, a theory I agree with more.</p>

<p>In the end, absolute music is wallpaper, but it's not boring the way that wallpaper is boring and also it contains emotion which wallpaper also lacks. Also absolute music has more than the two dimensions of wallpaper. Also it's temporal which wallpaper is not. So, music and wallpaper both have repeated patterns.</p>
