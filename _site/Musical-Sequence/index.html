            <p>The premise of this chapter seems to be that absolute music, or music without words, needs to be compared to something else—such as literature, an organism or wallpaper—in order to be taken seriously. That music must be in reference, be a metaphor to some other medium, seems to me unreasonable. Is the same demanded of the other art forms? Looking at music in terms of other media can only highlight differences, such as the existence of repetition, but not really address music as a form itself.</p>

<p>Kivy does allow that absolute music is art, is a great creation even though much of the essay seems intent on trivializing absolute music through forcing a comparison. If the literature and organism theories fail due to the repetition of absolute music, what of music with vocals? Are there similar theories for vocal music? If not why not? If the existence of repetition in absolute music makes creates a difficulty this same difficulty should exist in lyrical music yet this is not addressed in the essay.</p>

<p>The above aside, Kivy makes a good argument for the wallpaper theory. Wallpaper and Persian rugs and music share repetition and the repetition is key to the work and not simply a space filler or lack of original thought. The notion that in a repeated pattern each repetition is slightly different than the one before or after due exactly to the temporal relations is, it seems, obvious. Yet though it is obvious there is probably some value to stating and describing the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the essay Kivy says that emotion and feeling are inherent to music, are aroused in the listener by the music. This is different than This Is Your Brain On Music where the emotional quality of music is cultural, a theory I agree with more.</p>

<p>In the end, absolute music is wallpaper, but it’s not boring the way that wallpaper is boring and also it contains emotion which wallpaper also lacks. Also absolute music has more than the two dimensions of wallpaper. Also it’s temporal which wallpaper is not. So, music and wallpaper both have repeated patterns.</p>

            <p><strong>A response to chapter two of This Is Your Brain On Music by Daniel J. Levitin.</strong></p>

<p>This chap­ter was mostly about rhythm, though also loud­ness and key. It was about what makes music music aside from notes and tim­bre.</p>

<p>Much of the sec­tion on rhythm was spent iden­ti­fy­ing rhythm and ex­plain­ing ex­actly what it is which was mostly re­view for me. Lev­itin did men­tion the back­beat which was char­ac­ter­is­tic to rock and roll. I would have liked to read about how dif­fer­ent types of rhythms and me­ters cor­re­spond to dif­fer­ent styles or gen­res of music. Sousa marches are al­most al­ways in 4/4 time as is dance music but the meter in each is dif­fer­ent though I can’t quite char­ac­ter­ize how.</p>

<p>In the first Lev­itin said that loud­ness is a psy­cho­log­i­cal phe­nom­e­non and not a mea­sur­able qual­ity in­her­ent in sound. I didn’t to­tally buy this at first but de­cided that Lev­itin knew what he was say­ing. Then he elab­o­rated on this no­tion say­ing that in­creases in am­pli­tude do not lin­early cor­re­late to per­ceived loud­ness seemed an ar­gu­ment for loud­ness being a men­tal con­struc­tion. But then there is a mea­sur­able way in which am­pli­tude and loud­ness cor­re­spond. Loud­ness then seems to be a nit­pick­ing way of say­ing that peo­ple ex­pe­ri­ence sound dif­fer­ently. If peo­ple ex­pe­ri­ence sound dif­fer­ently is there a way of know­ing how loud­ness will be in­ter­preted by most lis­ten­ers and cre­at­ing music and sound to cater to that au­di­ence?</p>

<p>Com­ing from mostly pro­gram­ming classes last se­mes­ter where every word had a spe­cific mean­ing and usage as well as in­ter­pre­ta­tion it is a bit con­fus­ing to get in to words, de­f­i­n­i­tions and sub­ject ma­te­r­ial that is sub­jec­tive. But what should I ex­pect? Music is ex­pe­ri­en­tial and made for hu­mans not for com­put­ers to un­der­stand.</p>

<p>It was re­as­sur­ing to hear that most every­one ap­prox­i­mates tempo and rhythm with a 4% mar­gin of error, so I’m not en­tirely far off when clap­ping along. As well that the human ear and brain work to­gether to quan­tize the notes of a piece of music. The lit­tle bit of Able­ton Live that I’ve played around with I thought that the quan­ti­za­tion fea­ture was a bit of a cheat for less-than-great com­puter mu­si­cians but if the ear does this as well then maybe it’s al­right for my com­puter to help out my brain.</p>

            <p><strong>A response to the first chapter of <em>This Is Your Brain On Music</em> by Daniel J. Levitin.</strong></p>

<p>At age 25, 10 years of which were spent learning piano and saxophone, and most of the rest listening to music I had heard many of the terms defined in the first few pages of <em>What Is Music?</em> but knew them more as vague notions and emotions than technical definitions. The most surprising bit was that pitch and loudness are wholly mental constructs. I had always thought of pitch and loudness as pitch and loudness and that is just how it is.</p>

<p>I had casually wondered how different instruments generated different sounds when playing identical notes. It wasn’t a matter of the frequency so what could it be? I’m trying to wrap my head around overtones. It is still unclear if overtones are a finite set of frequencies or if they exude from the fundamental tone upwards forever. Is there any reason the overtones aren’t undertones?</p>

<p>Shapes of graphs instantly popped in to my head while reading that varying loudnesses of overtones influence the timbre of a sound. Could it be possible to make a morphable graph to create any sound desired? Of course this is a synthesizer, but I really want to create a program that allows the user to draw the shape of the overtones and click and drag at individual points as a experimentation for the shape that sounds from instruments create.</p>

<p>The section describing the tonal system and fractions and differences between keys and how if a piece is written in C but the note distribution is more like A… I got lost on this. Reading about it was not very enlightening without being able to the scales out with a real instrument. So I got out a MIDI keyboard and did try to noodle about, and it’s starting to make sense.</p>
