<p>As Ireland's national theatre, Abbey Theatre has shaped Ireland and the idea of Ireland since it was founded by W.B. Yeats in 1904.</p>

<p>Abbey Theatre came to Front in 2009 and asked us to re-develop their site from the ground up. I was responsible for the research, requirements gathering and experience strategy for the new site, working closely with the Theatre's marketing, design and technical teams.</p>

<p>The new site was created to give both Irish people and visitors to Ireland <em>unprecedented insight</em> into the workings of the theatre, and to offer an online experience that felt like <em>a natural extension</em> of a visit to the Theatre.</p>

<p>We gave the Theatre's backstage departments a home on the site, and coached them as they started to blog and show their work.</p>

<p>We developed the first online interface to Abbey's <a href="http://www.abbeytheatre.ie/archives">extensive archive</a>; a treasure trove of Irish cultural history.</p>

<p>We completely re-developed the ticket purchasing experience so that customers could see a photo-realistic view from their seat when making a purchase - something no other Irish theatre offered at the time.</p>

<p>The project was very meaningful for me, and I'm proud of the results. The site has continued to flourish since its launch.</p>
