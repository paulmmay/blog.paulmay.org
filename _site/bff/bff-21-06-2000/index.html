		<p>Hey Everybody! I know it's been ages since the last update, the usual excuses apply. Today's update features a new RealAudio file of Barrytown from the Me, Myself and Irene soundtrack. I have to admit, when I heard that the band were going to do a Steely Dan cover I felt mildly ill, but the song has grown on me, and it actually sounds a bit like old BFF stuff (Half Asleep...?). You can hear Barrytown here or on the RealAudio page. If you want to sing along, here are the lyrics too. For those of you in the US, the band will perform Barrytown on "The Late Show with David Letterman" on CBS on July 19th.</p>

<p>I've also updated the long-neglected People on the Armchair page, so if you sent me your details in the last few months, then your profile should be up. If you sent me your details, and I haven't posted them, mail me and I'll try to post them ASAP. As ever the profiles are indexed by your last-name. If you'd like to be on the People on the Armchair page, click here for details.</p>
