		<p class="intro">Experiments in representing earthquake data as sound.</p>


<p>Following the catastrophic earthquake in Japan I wanted to find a way in which I could represent earthquake data in a more communicative way than a map.</p>

<p>I've never really been a fan of earthquake maps - aside from aberrations, over time they essentially plot the outline of the earth's tectonic plates and fault lines. For me, there is a much closer mapping between earthquakes and sound waves, so I've tried to represent the last 30 days of earthquakes as sound.</p>

<p>In all cases, I am taking data from the USGS Shakemap feed at <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/rss.xml">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/rss.xml</a> and using Processing to send MIDI into GarageBand, then exporting the resulting file as a waveform. Also, while the earthquakes are not evenly spaced in time - the notes I'm producing are. For now I'm more interested in depth and magnitude of the earthquakes mapping to pitch and volume; once I've solved those problems I can move on to the representation of time.</p>

<h3>Challenges, What I Learned</h3>

<p>These experiment really highlight how careful you need to be when mapping data to another form, or another scale. In the case of the earthquake data, the Richter scale is a logarithmic scale where each whole number is 10 times greater than the previous one; an earthquake measuing 9.0 is 10 times more powerful than one measuring 8.0 and so on. In MIDI, the volume of a note ranges from 0-127. In the experiments where I map straight from a rounded integer of the Richter measurement to MIDI the result makes smaller earthquakes sound much closer in force to larger ones.</p>

<p>Also, the experiment showed me that simultaneous, dramatic changes in pitch and volume are hard to process - I found myself listening to changes in pitch, or listening to changes in volume; but trying to keep track of both at the same time was almost too much information at the same time. Something I'll keep in mind in later experiments.</p>

<h3>Single Chord - Simple Depth and Volume Mapping</h3>

<p>My first experiment; the depth of the earthquake in the Earth's crust is mapped to the pitch of the note, and its Richter measurement is mapped to the Midi volume (problematic).</p>

<h3>Simple Depth and Volume Mapping</h3>

<p>In this piece of audio, the notes are evenly spaced - with the depth of the earthquake in the Earth's crust is mapped to the pitch of the note, and its Richter measurement is mapped to the Midi volume (problematic).</p>

<h3>Single Note, Simple Volume Mapping</h3>

<p>I removed the pitch element which represented the depth of the earthquake; mostly because the change in pitch is far more jarring than the change in volume, but isn't as important from a human perspective (given the Richter scale is a measurement of seismic energy).</p>

<p>In this sample, the Richter value is mapping straight to the 0-127 MIDI volume scale - which produces really problematic effect; effectively ignoring the logarithmic property of the Richter scale and making all earthquakes sound much closer in magnitude.</p>

<h3>Single Note, Somewhat Logarithmic Volume</h3>

<p>In this sample I am mapping the Richter value to a somewhat logarithmic value for the volume. For each point on the Richter scale from 9.0 to 0.0, the maximum volume of the note halves. This gives a spread of volumes that is discernable by the human ear, and somewhat solves the problem of weaker earthquakes sounding similar to more powerful ones.</p>

<h3>Update - 15th March 2011</h3>

<p><p class="update">Thanks for the positive feedback on this work. I've done two more experiments; in both of these samples <strong>the timing of the earthquakes is relative</strong> whereas before they were all evenly spaced. I've compressed the time by a factor. The volume of the note also now uses a r<strong>easonably accurate mapping from the logarithmic Richter scale to the note's volume</strong>.</p>

<p>In the first I've mapped the depth of the earthquake to the pitch of the piano note.</p>

<p>In this sample I have stripped out the depth and am just using a single drum beat.</p>

<p>For now, these are the last experiments using earthquake data. I've learned a lot, and it's helped me get my head around the unfolding catastrophe in Japan in my own small way.</p>
