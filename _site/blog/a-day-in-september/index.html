<div class="content">
<p>On the 11th of September 2001 I helped my Dad move out of his office; a small unit in an industrial estate on the outskirts of Dublin, now the former home of his two-man company.</p>

<p>His business partner had used the company like an ATM. The business faltered, then folded. We gathered what was left and loaded it into a borrowed white van; some tools, desks, a chair and a filing cabinet.</p>

<p>As we drove away Joe Duffy was on the radio. It sounded like there had been a plane crash somewhere, or a disaster. Something had happened in New York and now listeners were calling in to the program.</p>

<p>We stopped at a local pub and ordered soup and sandwiches. The small TV above the corner of the bar was showing news footage of a plane hitting a building. Later we'd discover that there were two more planes. The next day I watched a memorial service held in Dublin live on the television. I remember crying during one of the hymns.</p>

<p>I left Ireland on the 14th to visit my brother in Chicago. People had been stranded at Heathrow for days and were lining up to get on any flight leaving for the US.
I was accommodated on my scheduled flight. We ate food, we drank and enjoyed ourselves. The city was warm and quiet. The Sears Tower was closed.</p>

<p>Now, many years later, I live in New York. There is a sadness about the place today, more police at the train station, maybe a nervousness on the subway.</p>

<p>I think about that day every year; about small things - the oddness of it all, the remnants in the back of the van and ham sandwiches. I think about my Dad, who has had to rebuild from scratch more than once. I think about how much I love him and I hope that he's doing okay.</p>
