<p class="intro">A little bit of digging into one following the publication of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC). </p>


<p>On the 27th of January the <a href="http://www.fcic.gov/" title="Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission">Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission</a> published its <a href="http://c0182732.cdn1.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/fcic_final_report_full.pdf" title="report">report</a>; <strong>the product of 19 days of hearings, interviews with over 700 witnesses and a review of many millions of pages of documentation</strong> relating to the financial crisis. I haven't had a chance to read the report, even open it, but the report's website is <a href="http://www.fcic.gov/resource/document-archive" title="a treasure-trove of documentation">a treasure-trove of documentation</a>.</p>

<p>One document that caught my eye is &#8220;<a href="http://www.fcic.gov/documents/view/608" title="Goldman Sachs Abacas Trades">Goldman Sachs Abacas Trades</a>&#8221; from November 2003. The document contains details of sales of subprime-mortgage backed collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) under a scheme called <strong>Abacus</strong>. <strong>Two Irish banks feature in the document</strong>, Anglo Irish Bank and Allied Irish Bank. AIB is shown to have bought $80m of Abacus and Anglo Irish bought $11m.</p>

<p>Abacus became incredibly controversial; partly because the mortgages it wrapped up and sold as investments were very risky (toxic), but also because later (in 2006) it is alleged that one of Goldman's major clients - a hedge fund called Magnetar - <a href="http://www.propublica.org/blog/item/other-major-banks-did-deals-similar-to-goldmans" title="encouraged Goldman to include higher and higher risk mortgages in the CDOs">encouraged Goldman to include higher and higher risk mortgages in CDOs like Abacus</a>, sponsored their creation (buying the highest risk components of the deals, making them viable), then <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2010/04/22/goldman-wasn-t-alone.html" title="bet against the performance of the CDO">bet against their performance</a>. Magnetar <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/04/20/magnetar-denies-creating-faulty-c-d-o-s/" title="denies this">denies any part in the creation of these high-risk deals</a>.</p>

<p>One case, involving Goldman Sachs employee Fabrice Tourre who created and sold the CDO called &#8220;Abacus 2007-AC1&#8221; <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/04/19/fabrice-tourre-fabulous-or-fatally-flawed/" title="is notorious">is notorious</a>; Tourre bragged that he would be the only one left standing when deals like Abacus came crashing down - but it appears as though his deal was one in a long line of very risky stuff packaged and sold on to investors by Goldman Sachs.</p>

<p>So, in short - Abacus CDOs were risky, and in some cases may have been set up to fail so that companies going short on Abacus CDOs like Magnetar would make a profit.</p>

<p>In subsequent years Abacus CDOs did indeed <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_20091124/ai_n42283996/" title="fail, spectacularly">fail, spectacularly</a> to the point where thy became &#8220;impaired&#8221; beyond the point of no return. I am not sure what happened to AIB and Anglo's liability; perhaps the whole value of their investment in Abacus CDOs was written off - who knows.</p>

<p>From this one document you see that Irish banks were in the mix with a lot of very large global banks, hedge funds - investing in risky stuff, playing with the big children. There are millions of other documents like this - It's fascinating, scary stuff.</p>
