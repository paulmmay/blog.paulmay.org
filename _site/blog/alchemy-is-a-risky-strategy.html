		<p class="intro">This is a brief prelude to a series of articles I'm writing on the ongoing management of web sites and services; some friendly advice on being very honest with yourself or your client when an idea is just, well, bad. </p>
<h3 id="ideas-are-neither-scarce-nor-fragile">Ideas are Neither Scarce nor Fragile</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/aboutus/toddw.php">very smart man</a> once said that ideas aren’t scarce, and aren’t fragile. There are millions of ideas out there, I’ve just had a couple while typing this, and <strong>genuinely good ideas will survive a bit of a pummeling</strong>; a bit of validation at the hands of you know - humans.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, and all too frequently in my experience,** terrible ideas do indeed persist to the project stage, completely unchallenged<strong>. These are the ideas that should have been changed radically, or binned earlier in the process</strong>.</p>

<p>We’ve all been in the scenario where <strong>a client has a budget, a team, and one seriously awful idea</strong>. The project proceeds on the wafer-thin hope that users, data, or charisma will persuade them of all your much better ideas down the road.  My advice to you is to <strong>walk away from projects where the client is resolved to try their hand at alchemy</strong> - it just doesn’t work.</p>

<p>At the very least, you should be deeply suspicious where there isn’t some kind of idea-validation built into a project from the outset - where a client hasn’t allowed room for ideas to be challenged, dropped, developed or improved; or where your team is just plain nervous that this isn’t going to work. At the very least, be honest with your client - tell them your concerns. You’ll probably be the first person to have raised an eyebrow.</p>

<h3 id="omg-its-still-lead">OMG It’s Still Lead</h3>

<p>**No amount of post-project hustle, analysis or mumbo-jumbo is going to save you if you are doggedly focused on delivering something that nobody wants. **Your web team won’t save you, your content strategist won’t save you and Google Analytics won’t save you. You’ll be hustling/collaborating, writing/editing and measuring/segmenting your way towards the inevitable conclusion that this is a service that humans don’t want, and should never have been a project in the first place.</p>

<p>The flakier among you will turn to some of the flakier techniques to try to “boost traffic” but this is just sleight of hand at the magic show.</p>

<h3 id="now-what">Now What?</h3>

<p>So, in my next article on managing sites and services after launch what I’m going to (cheekily) presuppose is that you are starting your project on a solid foundation (common sense):</p>

<ol>
* **You have a good understanding of the people who'll use your services**; you've talked to them, you understand the messy context they live in, you have studied their needs.
* **You've decided what not to do**; you've filtered out (and carefully saved for later) everything that isn't fundamental to the site/service. The core of what you'll do first, why and for whom is clear.
* **You're prepared to have 1. and 2. challenged or improved over time**; especially in the light of new input from the people who'll use your service.
* **You've set a number of objectives** that will help you gauge the success/failure of your idea and prompt course-corrections when necessary.
* **After all is said and done, people are still excited about the idea** and preferably people who don't report to you.
</ol>

<p>This is a <em>gross</em> over-simplification of some of the thought processes that underlie successful projects. From time to time, yes, it’s whim - a dream in the face of impossible odds and overwhelming evidence - but very, very rarely. If you’d like the success of your site to be more of a sure thing than a stab in the dark then I highly recommend having this stuff clearly defined, challenged and tested before you spent too much time on your junior alchemist’s kit.</p>

<p>Onwards, we’ll step forward into the real stuff very soon.</p>
