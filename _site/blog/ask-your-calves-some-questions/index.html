<p>I had my first Club Run with <a title="Piranha Triathlon Club" href="http://www.piranhatri.com" target="_parent">Piranha</a> today in the Phoenix park. It was good fun, and everybody was very Friendly (cheers for the lift to Drumcondra, Feargal). It was great to see all the different levels of ability being catered for by the club; everything from the puny beginner like myself to those who have been doing the sport for years. Everybody was very careful to warm up properly, and the coach John Davis had some good tips on how not to kill myself on the first run - mainly by keeping my heart-rate at around 70% of my max, and slowing down if I wasn't able to speak to the person running next to me. It sounds simple, but it was good to hear.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm looking forward to the session on Monday in Irishtown stadium, and then the dreaded swimming on Tuesday morning. Onwards and upwards.</p>
