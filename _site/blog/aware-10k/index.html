<h1>Aware 10K</h1>  
    <p class="intro"></p>


<p>I took part in the Aware 10K in the Phoenix Park yesterday. It was a great run; well attended (over 1000 runners) and well organised by Aware and Donore Harriers. The weather was  bright and fresh with no wind - a perfect Sunday morning.</p>

<p>The course was tough enough with some lovely hills in the second half (the pass by the Magazine Fort is dodgy enough on a bike - running it is absolutely no fun) and a 500m dogleg turn away from the finish line at the 9K mark - just at the point where turning away from the finish was the last thing I wanted to do. I made it around in 48 minutes 32 seconds - a personal best for 10K and 11 minutes quicker than my Port Tunnel time. Average heart rate was 168 for the run, so a bit higher than the 160 last week. I'm very happy to have run a good time, and to have been able to raise money for <a href="http://www.aware.ie" target="_parent">Aware</a>. Well done to everybody who took part. Probably no more running until the new year.</p>

<p>Happy Christmas to you all.</p>
