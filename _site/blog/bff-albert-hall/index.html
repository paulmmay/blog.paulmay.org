		<p>What a night! The Albert Hall gig was an absolute stormer! After the shoddy opening act Geneva went off, the boys came on played for nearly 2 hours. They were accompanied by strings and brass, and by Fleming and John on vocals and flugelhorn. I'm pretty much stuck for words....it was such a great night.
After the show I got to talk to Ben, Darren and Robert and the wonderful Fleming and John who are two of the nicest people I've ever met. Thanks to Will Brady and his mates for sharing their Pringles with me, Frank Maynard and Doug Goodman for getting me the VIP pass and ticket, and to all the crew, fans and musicians who posed for photographs and talked to me afterwards at the party. Hopefully the photos will help you picture the scene, enjoy!</p>
