<p class="intro"></p>


<p>Chicago knows how to throw a party, run an event, host thousands of people jabbering about a particular topic, put up with strange equipment and strange demands (where can I get bananas at 5am?) and then when that particular set of nutcases has gone the city does it again, and again, and again. Chicago is a Big Event town, and the Chicago Triathlon was a pretty big event by anybody's standards.</p>

<p><strong>Two days before the event</strong> we cycled the run and swim courses with one of the team members who did the event last year; <a href="http://www.rte.ie/health/2004/0420/health1008294.html" target="_parent">Nick O'Hare</a> who knew a thing or two about swimming. <a href="http://www.chicagotriathlon.com/04img/c_swim.gif">The swim course</a> seemed pretty daunting, a <a href="http://www.chicagotriathlon.com/04img/c_swim.gif">350 metre leg south</a>, then a turn towards the north and 1150 straight swimming parallel to the harbour wall. Straightforward, but scary seeing the long part of the course stretched straight out. At least the water would be fairly calm, and salt-free!</p>

<p><strong>The morning of the race</strong> was really exciting; we were up at the ungodly hour of 4am, over to the transition area to set up our bikes and gear, with everybody locked out of transition at 5.45am before the first of the sprints set off at 6am. The weather was cool and dry, perfect conditions for the race.</p>

<p>After setting up there was nothing to do but walk the course, go to the toilet and hang around for a while. I was in <strong>swim wave 21 at 7.41am</strong>, so I only had enough time to take a quick walk back to the hotel, but there was no going back to a sleep or anything. I got back to the race start at about 7am to warm up. I did my physio excercises, and when he wasn't looking, I shamelessly copied the warmup routine Matt Coughlan was doing (thanks Matt!). 7.30am came around, so I pulled up my wetsuit and went to queue with the other International Distance (Olympic) competitors. To be honest, I wasn't worried; I had flipped out in Athlone and I knew that the first 750m was going to be tough as I got into my breathing. Knowing that it was going to be tough made it okay. I stayed to the back of the wave, and at 7.41 we were off.</p>

<p>The first 750m of the swim was very very rough. Elbows and kicks and pulling and dragging (it felt a bit like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3S0wu4Zbfk" target="_parent">this</a>). I think I probably stayed too far back because there were some swimmers way slower than me, and some who looked fit but didn't look like they had done a whole lot of swimming. So, the first half of the swim was a bit miserable. Crossing the half-way mark was a great boost, and from then on I just kept the head down and ploughed on. It was great to see my brother, sister in law and uncle walking along side me on the bank when I turned to breathe, their support really helped me on the day. My left calf went a bit mental 10m from the shore, but the 400m jog to the transition helped it a lot. By the transition I was calm and had my breath back.</p>

<p>Suit off, glasses on, helmet on, socks on, shoes on, run for your feckin life! <strong>The cycle course stretched 10K north</strong> <a href="http://www.chicagotriathlon.com/04img/c_bike.gif" target="_parent">on Lakeshore Drive</a>, and then back again to complete the loop. 2 laps at a good 30Kph, chatting to Aoife a bit as I went. My quads and hamstrings were a bit tight but no major problems. A bottle and a half of my drink and half a delicious flapjack kept me occupied and fed as I went. I feel like I probably could have gone faster on the bike, but I was saving myself for the run. In retrospect I was shattered on the run anyway, so an extra few Kph might have made up some time. Anyway, a straightforward out and back cycle course and into transition for the run. I lost my way a bit and thought I spent ages looking for my spot, but I did a fairly quick transition; it just felt like ages. I found my spot on the rack because I had left a banana by my wetsuit. Good work banana!</p>

<p><strong>The run was tough, really tough.</strong> I have done exactly 2 runs of longer than 5K this year. The first one was grand, the second one wrecked my left hip and lead to 6 weeks of physio. So, I wasn't expecting much. I just <a href="http://www.chicagotriathlon.com/04img/c_run.gif" target="_parent">put one foot in front of the other</a>, ignored the pain and took a bit of water on as I went. I just went at my own pace, and kept an eye on my watch to keep myself motivated. My family was there as well, which was great - cheering me on, which was really cool. The support from total strangers on the course was great. The Ireland singlet got a fair bit of attention, and it was nice to have Americans shouting "Good Job Ireland, Keep it up!".</p>

<p>With half of the run to go I knew that I could go <strong>sub 3 hours</strong> if I kept plugging away. So I did, though there was a bit when I reached the 4 mile marker when I thought they were taking the piss. I thought when we got to 800m to go I'd give it a bit of extra juice to make the finish look good, but there was nothing really left in the legs. I turned down onto the closing straight and <strong>crossed the line</strong> as the announcer shouted "Paul May from Dublin, Ohio&#8230;I mean Dublin, Ireland crosses the line!" Cheesy, but nice to hear as you're finishing a race. I spent a few minutes getting my legs back, standing in front of the mist machines they had set up, taking photos with my family. It was amazing! I had finished! Surreal! We watched the professional athletes (they really are sickeningly good, and are apparently followed everywhere by helicopters!) starting their race, and after after getting my gear out of transition we went for a nice lunch in Chinatown. A perfect day!</p>

<p>Finishing the Chicago Triathlon was an amazing, surreal experience; not one I'll ever forget. I'd like to thank <strong>John Staunton</strong> for introducing me to the sport, the <strong>staff at Crumlin Children's Hospital</strong> who did a fantastic job organising the week, my work colleageus <strong>Ed, Aoife, Pras, Eoghan and Laura</strong> for sticking with it and for being great people, my <strong>coaches and friends at Piranha</strong> for all their motivation and advice, my excellent physio <strong>Orla</strong> at <a href="http://www.sportsmedireland.ie" target="_parent">Sports Med Ireland</a> for getting me back on the road and helping me stay strong and fit in the run up to the race, <strong>my family</strong> for supporting me and for being there on the day, and <strong>Cliona</strong> for all her love and support from start to finish. A big thank you to everybody who donated towards the fundraising target; donations are of course still welcome.</p>

<p>And that's it! I'm going to keep the base training going over the winter, and who knows, maybe next year I'll do it all over again.</p>

<p>For now I'm taking the week off.</p>
