<p>Suddenly it's December. Work is going well. My home office is quite comfortable, and I have been more productive than I was when working from the local co-working space.</p>

<p>In my spare time this week I've been mapping out some changes I want to make to this site, and planning a few personal projects and longer articles I'd like to complete in 2014. Just sketches and post-its for now, but progress nonetheless.</p>

<p>My real reason for writing today is that I am in a little bit of a physical activity slump. From training 6 days a week up until August, I now find myself with a gorgeous new racing bicycle, access to the Oxford University gym, and every opportunity to exercise, but no motivation whatsoever.</p>

<p>Part of it, no doubt, has to do with being in a new city with absolutely no training buddies to call on. Part of it has to do with the lack of a concrete goal. Part of it has to do with the weather and scant daylight. Part of it has to do with overcoming the inertia of taking a few months off. A big part of it has to due with the accumulation of injuries, and the creeping realisation that I can't really run anymore.</p>

<p>I suppose I realised a few weeks ago that this is the slump that people get into when their body starts to weaken a little, and their legs start to thicken a little. Maybe this is a slump that a lot of people don't get out of. It certainly feels different from the familiar fraying of good habits I experience before I make an adjustment. I hope that writing about it helps me figure it out.</p>

<p>Cliona is in New York this weekend, then in California next week. I will be spending some time in Copenhagen, and maybe New York, before heading back to Dublin for Christmas.</p>

<p>I am not quite at ease today.</p>
