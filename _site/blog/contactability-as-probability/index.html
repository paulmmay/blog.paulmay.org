<p class="intro"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5465533059/" title="Contactability as Probability by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5291/5465533059_1c471b9948_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="Contactability as Probability" /></a>
Mobile devices allow diverse groups of people from all along our social graph to contact us wherever we are, but offer only rudimentary ways for us to control our contactability (toggling between available or unavailable). As mobile devices play a bigger and bigger role in our lives, I believe we'll need to add more control/granularity to this experience. In this sketch I propose a more probabilistic way to manage contactability - a kind of semi-permeable barrier with rules we can tweak and change to suit our lifestyles. Contactability as probability.</p>


<h3>(How) Would This Work?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5466185570/" title="contactability by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5100/5466185570_d24ea277cc_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="contactability" /></a><br />
The first allows the user to <strong>assign contacts into simple buckets of our own design</strong>; e.g. I can create a category and assign a contact to it. Ideally this would bring together contacts from across different apps and services - especially the ones that cause immediate interruptions - and serve as a single point of control for contactability.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5466130346/" title="Probability and Consequence by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5053/5466130346_acdf9b3632_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="Probability and Consequence" /></a><br />
The second step would <strong>allow us to assign a probability to people in these lists being able to contact us</strong>, and a consequence/action when they are not. e.g. everybody in my work list could be assigned a probability of <strong>Sometimes</strong> meaning that 50% of the time our probabilistic filter has no effect and they get direct access to us. The other 50% of the time, something happens - and we can control this something. You might give a much finer level of control; a sliding scale of contactability from 0-100 say.</p>

<p>The third step assigns a consequence when our filter is triggered. The item (a phone call, email, direct message, text message) could be directed to a bucket (voicemail, a mailbox etc)., given a particular status (a lower priority), or refused altogether (though this would be drastic I'll admit).</p>

<h3>Outcomes, Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>In the current context, <strong>a system like this maybe seems like a leap</strong> - because at the moment we are used to being able to gain access to somebody all the time without any friction; unlike physical communication where time and distance make being present with somebody on a whim difficult.</p>

<p>The one-size fits all approach that we have now means that by filtering out one group, we filter out everybody. I think a probabilistic system would offer users a way to <strong>prototype their contactability</strong>; I am getting too many calls from work - I want to turn down the volume on that over time. Or, my family is important to me - I always want them to be able to get to me. Over time we find an equilibrium.</p>

<p>There's a lot to think about here - but it'd be interesting to see what effect a system like this would have on the way we use mobile devices, and on the expectations we have of other people's availability.</p>
