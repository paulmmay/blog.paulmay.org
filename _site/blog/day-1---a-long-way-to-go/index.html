<p>The membership for the Triathlon club I'll be training with has been sent off, and I pick up my bike today, I've even bought a heart-rate monitor. Buying gear is easy, training really really isn't. My lovely housemate Aoife (a lifeguard and all-round swimming expert) took me to a pool today for some pointers before I start training properly next week.</p>

<p>Embarrassing isn't usually a word I like to use when describing myself; but it's appropriate in this case. I huffed and puffed my way up and down the lane, pausing every 25 metres or so to plead for mercy. I have an awful lot of work to do; building my fitness, endurance, technique&#8230;trying not to breathe underwater etc. I did a bit of running after fleeing the pool, probably about 4k slowly (very slowly).</p>

<p>I feel good though. I know I have a long way to go, but it's started now and there's no going back! I'm just focussing on what is a <em>very</em> worthy cause and ignoring the heavy legs. Please be generous, donate some cash, save some children's lives and give me even more reason to keep going.</p>
