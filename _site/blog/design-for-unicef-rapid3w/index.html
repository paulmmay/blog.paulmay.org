<p class="intro">Some thoughts and a quick sketch of a new aid supply order management tool for UNICEF. 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/unicefcanada/4899075582/" title="Supplies arrive in Karachi by UNICEF Canada, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4899075582_f7f80d2812_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="Supplies arrive in Karachi" /></a></p>


<h3>Background</h3>

<p>On our recent call with the UNICEF team in Pakistan they described <strong>the impact of a less than ideal aid supply order management system</strong> on their ability to get urgently needed supplies to people who need them.</p>

<p>Many <strong>steps, tools, processes and people are involved from the time they arrive at the scene of a disaster to the time necessary supplies arrive</strong>; and as with any complex organisation, all these moving parts have <strong>emerged over time in response to different situations</strong>. Some parts of the system work well, but others don't.</p>

<h3>The Last Mile</h3>

<p>Crucially, <strong>some of the parts of UNICEF's order management system closest to the people who need essential supplies are in need of a re-think</strong>. The way that aid workers request supplies for a particular location (using what is called a 3W [who, what, where] form - hence the name of our project), the way the worker gets an update on when those supplies will arrive, the way UNICEF tracks when those supplies arrive where they are needed, and (an increasingly important part of the system) the way they analyse information and provide it to partner organisations, governments and media. Suffice to say that <strong>if you ever thought that thinking about UX carefully and thoroughly didn't matter then a quick 5 minute conversation with UNICEF's should do the trick</strong>.</p>

<p>So, my rough, poorly worded starting point for the project is the question:</p>

<blockquote>What people, infrastructure, activities, information, feedback, systems, tools, experiences and training do UNICEF need to put in place to ensure that vital supplies get to the people who need them with as little friction, waste and harm as possible?
</blockquote>


<p>We are calling the sub-set of answers to these problems that we identify as being within our reach to answer Rapid3W. Notionally, Rapid3W is an improved emergency aid supply order management system for UNICEF. We fully understand that we can't replace/re-design the UNICEF supply chain, but <strong>we feel that we can solve problems at the point where aid workers request supplies, requests are processed and where information is aggregated/shared. </strong></p>

<h3>Where to Begin?</h3>

<p>Without further design research it is obviously <strong>impossible to say exactly infrastructure, activities, information, feedback, systems, tools, experiences, training UNICEF need to improve their order management systems</strong> - but it's a useful beacon to have in the distance.</p>

<p>Rather than proposing technology or new ideas to plug gaps, which I think is what got UNICEF to where they are now, maybe they should pause&#8230;.reflect&#8230;.research&#8230;put the users and beneficiaries of these tools first - and only then move forward. I know that's difficult when they face urgent needs every day, but in the long run it will pay dividends.</p>

<p>Here are some questions to start with:</p>

<ol>
* What **context do aid workers work in** - really? What is it like to be on the ground at the scene of a disaster faced with problems you may/may not have seen before?
* How do workers know **what is needed by the most people**? How do they filter through the innumerable needs they are faced with to identify the ones that should be solved first?
* Once the most crucial needs have been identified how does a worker match these needs to solutions? **How do they know what needs can be met with a &#8220;thing&#8221;** and what needs can be met with something else - or by somebody else?
* How do workers express these needs? **Where do they document them**, where do they put them, who do they tell?
* If you can't put a name to something, can you request it? I need something to help with X but I don't know what it is
* How does the request **get from where it is needed to where it can be fulfilled**? How do we know where here is, where there is? Do we need to know?
* How is the request **received, processed and either filled or not filled**? What are the criteria applied to requests being fulfilled or not?
* If other people nearby have similar needs, what do we do with that? Aggregate the orders, do nothing? Is this useful to know?
* If my request is approved, and **my &#8220;thing&#8221; is on its way to where it is needed - how does the requester/worker know**? What if they've gone home? What if the need isn't relevant anymore?
* When my requested thing arrives, how do I say **&#8220;I have this, thank you&#8221; or &#8220;I have this, there is a problem&#8221;** - or should I be able to do that?
* How do we **gather information about all of these touchpoints** without imposing unreasonable demands on the people throughout the chain?
* How do we know that we are doing the right things? How do we measure the effectiveness of this whole system?
* **How do we improve the system in response to rapidly changing/divergent contexts and new information** without having it degrade into complex, unusable mush?
* Once people know we have this information, **how is it given to/taken by them? Is it our job to make it accessible/visual/understandable? **Again, how do we make sure information gathering/dissemination doesn't cripple us and take us away from what we're supposed to be doing?


This might seem like a huge list of dry questions, but I actually think that a small amount of direct access and time with disaster relief workers and the UNICEF logistics team would get us a lot of the way forward;** what can we learn in two-three hours, rather than how can we get absolutely all of the answers we need right now. **

### The Project
So, working with Guang, Kimi and Macaulay - my lovely classmates - **we propose that Rapid3W is not some new piece of technology thrown into a context we don't understand - firstly, it's a structure to work through and a set of activities we apply to answer important questions**. We'll see where we are after that. 

Where we apply technology in the future - if we do - it should be fit for the types of contexts we have been told about; erring on the side of **less complexity/functionality**, likely to **operate with no/little connectivity**, **expectant of interruption**, tolerant of **fuzzy information**/input, able to offer **meaningful feedback**, **distributed**, **secure** - just plain **bulletproof**. 

So, let's see how far forward we can get in the next few weeks.
