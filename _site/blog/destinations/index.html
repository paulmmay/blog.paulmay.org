Destinations is a game of global travel and strategy designed by Steve Klise, Paul May, Natalie Be'er and Spike McCue as our final project the ITP Big Games class. </p>


<h3>Game Play</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5752006361/" title="Destinations - Game Map by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2399/5752006361_e5ac6080d7_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="Destinations - Game Map"></a></p>

<p>Destinations is a game that rewards players for travelling to far-flung parts of the world. Each country is assigned a number of points based on the number of connecting flights in and out of the country; the less connections there are, the more points a country is worth.</p>

<p>Players start in countries of equal value; and use the Destinations web application to book a flight to another country. Flights leave on the hour and flight durations vary depending on the distance being travelled; the shortest flights will last 30 minutes, the longest flights will last 2 hours. When a player's flight lands, they can can book another flight. Players may linger in a country if they wish. Players do not have to take a flight every turn.</p>

<p>Players will receive updates via SMS to tell them when their flight takes off or lands at which time they should go to the game board, and move their marker to their current destination. Players can view the current state of the world on a large map on the floor at ITP.</p>

<h3>Scoring and Winning</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5752022029/" title="Destinations - Scoreboard by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2571/5752022029_6ab8aee5f0_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="Destinations - Scoreboard"></a></p>

<p>Players travel around the world by plane, and receive points for the countries they have visited - once a player leaves a country, they start to earn points. Each player will continue to earn points every hour for a country they have left until another player arrives, and then leaves that country.</p>

<p>If two players are in the same country, the last to leave receives the points. If both players take the same flight out, they split the points evenly.</p>

<h3>Thoughts, Feedback</h3>

<p>Our goal was to design a game that offered people with limited time, living in a large city an experience that felt like travelling around the world.</p>

<p>Initially we thought about using elements of people's day to day commute as the core mechanic (maybe rewarding distance covered, or interactions of some kind) but this just didn't seem like fun, and we also recognised that the time people spend commuting to and from school/work (which in NY usually means taking the subway) is necessary down time, not really a time to be carrying out observation tasks or changing regular patterns.</p>

<p>Eventually we decided to create a game that would offer the feeling of global travel, but playable wherever players were and with light time commitment. We designed destinations as a kind of big board-game which would use the web and SMS messages to provide access and continuity wherever players happened to be when they wanted to play.</p>

<p>We got great feedback from the players after the game finished;</p>

<ul>
<li>The texture of the game, the aesthetic was really enjoyable - players did get a sense of competition, travel, fantasy.</li>
<li>The game was fun; all but one of the players continued for the full two day game.</li>
<li>People enjoyed the updates by text messages (&#8220;Hello Michael, your flight to Cuba has just departed from Iceland. Pack up those parkas and get out the sandals!&#8221;), but in a way being prompted to play removed the need for players to keep track of time themselves</li>
<li>Having an online map would be good, rather than having to go to the board to see the state of play. This is something we talked about, but didn't have time to implement.</li>
<li>It'd be good to think of making a better experience for spectators.</li>
<li>More players would help fill in the board, increase the sense of pressure - we had 7 players, 2 or 3 more would have been really good (or a smaller area of play).</li>
<li>A way to interact with the other players - a sense of communication between players during the game - would be good.</li>
<li>The game appeared to reward constant play - just continuing to book flights and travel each and every turn. The flip side of this is that the game punishes players who don't play constantly. There is probably a tweak here to make it acceptable for players to miss a turn without falling behind.</li>
</ul>


<p>Feedback from our instructor, Greg Trefry was also very encouraging:</p>

<blockquote>Great job with Destinations.&nbsp; This game had a lot going for it: elegant simplicity in the design, a mechanic that really took advantage of persistence and smart technical execution.

The basic mechanic of trying to skip around the world to accumulate points was great.&nbsp; And then tying your ability to move to length of flights and departure times was great.&nbsp; It's odd because the act of going to the airport to catch an actual flight is such an awful tedious, fraught experience.&nbsp; Yet the game is great because it lets you dream about traveling without the hassle of arriving two hours early and taking off your shoes.&nbsp; Finding this little bit of content that marries well with your game design can really be the secret sauce in game development.
</blockquote>


<p>All in all the feedback was very positive; we are now considering making the game available more widely - with some changes obviously.</p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>This was a great way to end our time in the Big Games class; which was by far the most complete, and most intriguing class I took this semester - thanks to Greg for making it such a great class, and to the rest of my classmates who made a lot of fun stuff this semeseter.</p>

<p>Huge thanks to Steve Klise who worked incredibly hard on the web component of the game - he was a real hero on this project.</p>
