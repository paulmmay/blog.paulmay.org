<h1>Dublin Docklands Aquathon 2006</h1>  
    <p class="intro"></p>


<p>Today I took part in the first <a href="http://www.aquathon.info/">Dublin Docklands Aquathon</a>, which was great fun (afterwards, obviously). There were 52 competitors, so it was a nice small race to end the season, and very well organised as well. The race was a 750m swim (after a 200m "warm up" to the swim start!), then a 5K run.</p>

<p>It was really great to go into the water beside the Jeanie Johnston; but the dead rat bobbing around 10 feet away was a bit offputting :) As expected, the water was pretty murky, but was fresher than I though - just a bit brackish. We swam off the dock to the start line, and after treading water for a few minutes we were off. My breathing was pretty poor, it's been a while since I've swam, but I made it without too many "What am I doing?" moments. We clambered out of the water at the Point Depot, and then off down the Quays towards the Customs' House on the run; we crossed the river at the Matt Talbot bridge and then ran did a loop before crossing back over the river and back towards the Point again.</p>

<p>I found the run pretty tough, I had a stitch for most of the course and at some stage I cut my foot, but I made it back in one piece, coming a fantastic 42nd place (but I don't mind). I haven't done any training since Chicago; but I managed to bluff my way through it.</p>

<p>So, that's the last event of the year for me - well done to the organisers for putting on a great, safe race. <a href="http://gallery.redbrick.dcu.ie/paulmay/aquathon2006/">The photos of the race are in the Gallery.</a></p>
