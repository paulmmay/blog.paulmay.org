<p class="intro">Today was my last day in my current job with Accenture. I got up a bit later than usual before getting the Dart into the head office - where I handed in my laptop and name badge, did the exit interview, and headed off into the wild blue yonder.</p>


<p>It's been an interesting couple of years. I've met some great people and worked on some interesting projects. I've traveled a bit, trained with people from all over the world, and taken up Triathlon. Working with a large (huge) multinational really opens your eyes; you see the scale that a company can grow to, the scale of the money that washes around the global economy, and the "machinery" companies put in place to stay big and get bigger.</p>

<p>On the negative side, I never felt as though the work I was doing was a good fit for my skills or interests. That's not to say that I didn't learn things, but that my job sometimes felt like a bit of a detour - and some days I found it hard to motivate myself; which is hard for somebody who considers himself to be pretty driven.</p>

<p>Before the money gets better, before I get a little bit older I'll take a leap and hope that my next job (which I'll talk about in coming days) is a much better fit. Belfast here we come.</p>
