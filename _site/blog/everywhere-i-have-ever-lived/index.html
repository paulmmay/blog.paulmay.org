		<p>We're leaving New York in June, departing for <em>we don't know where yet</em>. I can hardly believe that I'm moving again. By my count I've lived in 4 cities and approximately 12 houses/apartments in the past decade. This is the first time I've actually made a list of those places.</p>

My childhood home on Kilbarrack Road in Dublin. There's just too much to say about this great house. I drifted away slowly over the course of 2004/2005. My Dad sold the house few years later.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8052/8436956268_39398a9b97_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of East 53rd Street, Hyde Park, Chicago" class="fullwidth"/>
In the summer of 2002 I spent 4 months living on East 53rd Street in Hyde Park, Chicago. I couldn't find a job, and was down to my last few dollars when I happened to bump into some other Irish people who worked at the Adler Planetarium. They recommended me for a job there, and I scraped by for another 2.5 months before heading back to Dublin. A very strange summer.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8221/8436957516_7c215675b7_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Shanowen Road, Dublin" class="fullwidth"/>
For about three months of 2004 I lived in an apartment on Shanowen Road near DCU. My housemates were Michael Moriarty and Nicky Gallogly. I can't for the life of me remember how the three of us ended up living together, but it was nice.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8237/8435872435_c071b5b63f_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Glasnevin, Dublin" class="fullwidth"/>
For a very brief period of 2004 or 2005, maybe a couple of months, I lived somewhere in Glasnevin, Dublin. I don't know the exact address and have incredibly patcy memories of this whole experience.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8369/8435883069_b8b0abe50d_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Dargle Road, Dublin" class="fullwidth"/>
In 2005 I moved into a small house on Dargle Road in Drumcondra.  My housemates were Ciara Gogarty, Aoife McNamara, Eoin Norton, and for a very brief period, Padraig Kilbride. The house was decrepit, the landlord was a spiv, and the dishes were never done, but we had fun there. The incident with the rat wasn't much fun.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8435872221_606ab2c1ca_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Booterstown Park, Dublin" class="fullwidth"/>
In 2006 I moved to a rather grand house on Booterstown Park; my first foray onto the South Side of Dublin. My housemates were Karl Podesta, Louise Connolly, and Johnny Callaghan. Even though this was a very quiet street in a very quiet area, I really enjoyed living here. My room was huge, the garden was great, the kitchen was great, and everybody did their bit to keep the house in working order. It was a really pleasant experience all round. Not cheap though.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8224/8435873423_1451725dee_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Titania Street, Belfast" class="fullwidth"/>
In 2007 I quit my wretched job in management consulting and moved to Belfast to work at Front (now part of Monotype). I lived in a little house on Titania Street off the Cregagh Road, first in the attic room, then in a nicer front-facing room. My constantly rotating cast of housemates included Emma, Aasa, Greg, and Mario. They were all very nice.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8463/8435871471_3cb41c70e0_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Rossmore Avenue, Belfast" class="fullwidth"/>
In February of 2009 the constantly changing cast of characters at Titania Street, and a desire to be closer to both work and a swimming pool, prompted me to relocate across the city to Rossmore Avenue. My new housemates were Cassie, Breda, Chris, Johann, and for a short time, Emma.</p>

I spent weekdays in Belfast, but came back to Dublin on weekends to stay with Cliona. I was frequently to be found at her place on Parnell Street. Cliona's flatmates, Beatriz and then Kate, tolerated me beyond the call of duty and reason.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8502/8435871615_d9a2009481_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of North Great George's Street, Dublin" class="fullwidth"/>
In September of 2009 I managed to persuade the folks at Front to let me work from Dublin 2 days a week. Me and Cliona rented a really nice basement/garden apartment on North Great George's Street in Dublin. This is probably the most fabulous place I will ever live. We had a spare bedroom and a huge garden. We are able to have parties without bothering a soul. We spent a happy year here in the run up to our wedding.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8080/8436957678_23eb4605cc_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Sagimor Gardens, Belfast" class="fullwidth"/>
In 2009/2010 I was spending 3 nights a week in Belfast, and 4 nights a week in Dublin, so to cut down on costs I moved out of Rossmore Avenue in Belfast and rented a tiny room in a house in East Belfast. The owner of the house, Sarah, was very nice. She was saving up so that she could quit her job and go sailing for a year. I don't know if she ever went.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8435873717_e92f8a68e3_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Ocean Avenue, Brooklyn" class="fullwidth"/>
In August 2010 I arrived in New York to start at NYU. I spent a couple of weeks staying with Courtney Kelly, but soon found a great apartment on Ocean Avenue in Prospect Leffert Gardens. Cliona arrived in New York a couple of months later, and we are still living on Ocean Avenue 2.5 years later. This really feels like home. I hope, probably in vain, that the next place we live is as good to us as this place has been.</p>
