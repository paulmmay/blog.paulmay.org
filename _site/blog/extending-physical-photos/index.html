<p class="intro">A proposal for my final project for ITP's Introduction to Physical Computing class. A system that lets people add digital information to physical photographs. Tell the story of a physical photograph, save that story somewhere safe, and then retrieve it later.

<h3>Read the Full Writeup of Photo+</h3>

<p class="update">This article is the initial proposal for Photo+, but the (much more interesting) <a href="http://paulmay.org/blog/photoplus" title="full writeup of Photo+ is over here">full writeup of Photo+ is over here</a>.

### Concept
(Before I begin, this is still something I'm exploring - I'm writing this as a way of understanding what I want to design/build; don't expect 100% clarity&#8230;.or brevity.)

I'm interested in **the powerful connection between physical objects and memory**. Take my favourite mug as an example; its significance to me has very little to do with its physical form and much more to do with the story of where it came from. When I hold the mug, I am able to recall this story with real clarity. **Objects are tangible interfaces to information** that would otherwise be harder to access. <sup>(1)</sup>

There's another side to this; **when we don't have access to physical objects, we don't have access to the memories they evoke - we forget**. When we file away items, or put things in the attic we aren't just moving objects - **we're saying that, for now, we don't need direct access to the memories that these objects evoke**. When and if we do go to retrieve these objects, we get the chance to re-find and reinterpret our memories. I think this is a hugely valuable process.

### Photos as Tactile Interfaces
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5183748464/" title="A Tangible Interface by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1304/5183748464_18b5e94311_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="A Tangible Interface" /></a><br />
For me, the tactility of a physical, **printed photo connects me to the story behind the image in a way that a digital photo does not.** Because physical photos are less accessible, and fewer in number - I get to re-discover them each time I open an album or a box of photos, and they feel more valuable. My digital photos are constantly available to me, and I have thousands more of them - but when I look at them I don't get a sense of re-discovery. At the same time, digital photos **offer me a richer ability to store facts about the content and story of an image**. Digital photos can be shared, discussed, remembered and built upon by many people in a way that physical photos can't. 

### Finding a Middle Ground: Extending the Physical Photo
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5183748138/" title="Explaining this to Myself by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4126/5183748138_544d726b07_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="Explaining this to Myself" /></a><br />
I want find a point between the value of the physical photograph, and the capabilities of a digital photograph. I don't want the user to have to scan their photo, creating a &#8220;new&#8221; instance of the photo - I want it to retain its original, physical format - but with new capabilities. **I'll design and build a system that lets a user take a physical photograph, identify it uniquely to a computer, add digital information, and then put the photograph back where they found it** - to recall the information at a later date. The key parts of the system are:


* The photograph - essentially the photograph becomes a unique key - a tangible way to start the recording process, or the retrieval process.
* A way to recognise the photo - a system to identify that I want to record or recall information about a specific photo.
* A way to record input - a system to record digital information about the photograph
* Storage - a place to put the information
* Retrieval - a system to retrieve the information at a later date


### Next Steps
I want to shoot a simple video prototype of this very soon (ideally tomorrow), then get some feedback from my classmates. Once the idea is more pinned down I'll move forward with research and design; hopefully I should be on the right track by the end of the week.

### Footnotes
<sup>(1)</sup> Memory champions exploit the connection between objects and deeper stories by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci" title="associating information with objects and then placing these objects in an imagined space">associating information with objects and then placing these objects in an imagined space</a>. The act of recalling the information becomes a walk through this space to see and interact with objects.
