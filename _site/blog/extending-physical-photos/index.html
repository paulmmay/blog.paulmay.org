		<p class="intro">A proposal for my final project for ITP's Introduction to Physical Computing class. A system that lets people add digital information to physical photographs. Tell the story of a physical photograph, save that story somewhere safe, and then retrieve it later.

<h3>Read the Full Writeup of Photo+</h3>

<p><p class="update">This article is the initial proposal for Photo+, but the (much more interesting) <a href="http://paulmay.org/blog/photoplus" title="full writeup of Photo+ is over here">full writeup of Photo+ is over here</a>.</p>

<h3>Concept</h3>

<p>(Before I begin, this is still something I'm exploring - I'm writing this as a way of understanding what I want to design/build; don't expect 100% clarity&#8230;.or brevity.)</p>

<p>I'm interested in <strong>the powerful connection between physical objects and memory</strong>. Take my favourite mug as an example; its significance to me has very little to do with its physical form and much more to do with the story of where it came from. When I hold the mug, I am able to recall this story with real clarity. <strong>Objects are tangible interfaces to information</strong> that would otherwise be harder to access. <sup>(1)</sup></p>

<p>There's another side to this; <strong>when we don't have access to physical objects, we don't have access to the memories they evoke - we forget</strong>. When we file away items, or put things in the attic we aren't just moving objects - <strong>we're saying that, for now, we don't need direct access to the memories that these objects evoke</strong>. When and if we do go to retrieve these objects, we get the chance to re-find and reinterpret our memories. I think this is a hugely valuable process.</p>

<h3>Photos as Tactile Interfaces</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5183748464/" title="A Tangible Interface by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1304/5183748464_18b5e94311_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="A Tangible Interface" /></a><br />
For me, the tactility of a physical, <strong>printed photo connects me to the story behind the image in a way that a digital photo does not.</strong> Because physical photos are less accessible, and fewer in number - I get to re-discover them each time I open an album or a box of photos, and they feel more valuable. My digital photos are constantly available to me, and I have thousands more of them - but when I look at them I don't get a sense of re-discovery. At the same time, digital photos <strong>offer me a richer ability to store facts about the content and story of an image</strong>. Digital photos can be shared, discussed, remembered and built upon by many people in a way that physical photos can't.</p>

<h3>Finding a Middle Ground: Extending the Physical Photo</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5183748138/" title="Explaining this to Myself by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4126/5183748138_544d726b07_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="Explaining this to Myself" /></a><br />
I want find a point between the value of the physical photograph, and the capabilities of a digital photograph. I don't want the user to have to scan their photo, creating a &#8220;new&#8221; instance of the photo - I want it to retain its original, physical format - but with new capabilities. <strong>I'll design and build a system that lets a user take a physical photograph, identify it uniquely to a computer, add digital information, and then put the photograph back where they found it</strong> - to recall the information at a later date. The key parts of the system are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The photograph - essentially the photograph becomes a unique key - a tangible way to start the recording process, or the retrieval process.</li>
<li>A way to recognise the photo - a system to identify that I want to record or recall information about a specific photo.</li>
<li>A way to record input - a system to record digital information about the photograph</li>
<li>Storage - a place to put the information</li>
<li>Retrieval - a system to retrieve the information at a later date</li>
</ul>


<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>I want to shoot a simple video prototype of this very soon (ideally tomorrow), then get some feedback from my classmates. Once the idea is more pinned down I'll move forward with research and design; hopefully I should be on the right track by the end of the week.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

The act of recalling the information becomes a walk through this space to see and interact with objects.</p>
