<p>I am <em>really</em> enjoying Mark Cousins' series <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2044056/"><em>The Story of Film: An Odyssey</em></a> which is now available to stream on <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Story_of_Film_An_Odyssey/70261400?locale=en-US">Netflix</a>. It is a beautifully made documentary broken into 15, one hour-long episodes. <em>The Story of Film</em> traces the history of film from its birth through to the current day.</p>

<p>Unlike a lot of film historians, Cousins really goes out of his way to show examples of films from all over the world, like Yevgeni Bauer's <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0005916/">After Death</a></em> (<em>Posle Smerti</em>) from Russia, made in 1915 (above).</p>

<p>What really comes across is the rapid change that cinema underwent in the decades after its invention. By the time film was a couple of decades old it had been transformed from a curiosity into an art form. Fascination with the technology of filmmaking had been superseded by a fascination with new forms of storytelling enabled by technology.</p>

<p>By the 1920s filmmakers had formulated, refined and then deliberately subverted successive forms of film-making. The grammar of film was constantly being re-written and the result was innumerable, fascinating, deeply different films.</p>

<p>By comparison, today's cinema - and indeed all media - look timid and conformist. The web is about as old as cinema was during its heady days of experimentation and is becoming more cynical and homogenous each year. If the history of cinema tells us anything it's that we shouldn't be afraid to write a new rule book, or indeed to burn that rule book when things become too familiar.</p>

<p><em>The Story of Film: An Odyssey</em> is inspiring. It has put fire in my belly. I really recommend it.</p>
