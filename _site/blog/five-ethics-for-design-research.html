		<p class="intro">Design research is not always necessary, but where it is necessary, I think it should be done ethically and fairly - in a way that gets to useful conclusions without hurting people. In this article I've tried to boil down my point of view down into 5 ethics for design research. </p>
<p>Over the years I’ve probably guessed, self-taught, imitated, and gotten through most flavours of design research. It’s been really interesting - there is something really great about starting a design project with a goal and a set of questions, then working to get to a set of answers - which are then expressed in a service or product and improved over time.</p>

<p>The fact that while doing research I was learning <em>how</em> to do research never really bothered me - that’s life. What <em>did</em> bother me was the sense that sometimes I wasn’t being honest or fair in my research - that I was excluding uncomfortable options, or didn’t understand how to deal with people fairly - basically that I didn’t have a handle on the ethics of design research.</p>

<p>Now I see more and more research being done to inform design projects, and I’m sure other people have experienced similar issues along the way. This weekend, after completing a little observation study, I jotted down a few thoughts; five ethics that I think now underpin how I do design research.</p>

<h3 id="necessary">1. Necessary</h3>
<p>When I do design research, it has to actually be necessary. <strong>It needs to hurt that I don’t know things that I need to know.</strong> Design research is the way that I find answers that are material to the success of the project. It has to be about more than just getting to travel, getting to know people, building relationships or showing that I’m smart.</p>

<h3 id="designed">2. Designed</h3>
<p>When I do design research, it itself has to be designed - **I need to have crisp, clear questions that I’m trying to answer. **I need to choose the best way to answer those questions, using just the time and resources that I need. I need to have a clear approach to assess my research against how well those questions are answered. There is nothing to preclude serendipity, or the identification of other worthwhile questions, or all the great stuff that happens when doing research - but those aren’t reasons to start out without clarity.</p>

<h3 id="appropriate">3. Appropriate</h3>
<p>When I do design research I need to use the right tools for the right job. <strong>For every question, there is probably a right (or at least better) way of answering it.</strong> I need to become comfortable with the design and implementation of experiments. I need to be comfortable with careful reading. I need to understand data. I need to be comfortable observing, interacting with and interviewing people. Even as a human-centred designer, I need to acknowledge that most research looks more like reading a book than ethnography.</p>

<h3 id="fair">4. Fair</h3>
<p>When I do research I need to be open to having my own preconceptions challenged; in fact <strong>I should worry if I get to the end of a research exercise that doesn’t challenge or progress my initial thinking</strong>. As well as this basic commitment to fairness. I need to <strong>treat people I encounter with integrity</strong>. If they are helping me, answering questions - they need to understand the context of that assistance (what I’m doing, why, for whom) and they need to be able to revoke that participation no matter how inconvenient it might be for me.</p>

<h3 id="acted-upon">5. Acted Upon</h3>
<p>If my design research is appropriate and planned properly then <strong>I should be able to act upon its findings without fear</strong>. I may not know everything, but I didn’t set out to answer everything - so that’s okay. I should be able to say that because I know X from my research I did Y in my project.</p>

<h3 id="thats-it">That’s It</h3>
<p>I can’t say these points cover everything, but they are the corollary of most of the things I’ve done wrong over the years. I also can’t say that I hit the mark on these all the time, but I at least have a grasp of what I should be doing and why. Maybe you’ve struggled with your work too, and maybe you have a different take on ethical design research. Let me know - whatever that case - I’d love to hear your thoughts.</p>
