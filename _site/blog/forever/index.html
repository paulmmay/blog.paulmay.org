<p class="intro">Forever is an immersive experience for one person; created with Lily Szajnberg for the <i>Recurring Concepts in Art</i> class at ITP</p>


<h3>Concept</h3>

<p>In our Recurrning Concepts in Art class we were asked to take a previous project made at ITP and re-conceptualise/remake it without using technology.</p>

<p>Lily Szajnberg and I worked together to take two projects that involved tactility, physical sensation and strong emotion - merging them into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wLckYKyaXySeZikThJJt2VYPf2Z27fg2_Ad5xvssmFk/edit?hl=en_US" title="one project that could serve as an exploration of Spectacle">one project that could serve as an exploration of Spectacle</a>; in which we both shared an interest.</p>

<p>Our goal was to create an immersive, overwhelming experience for one person without using the traditional technologies of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Society_of_the_Spectacle" title="Spectacle">Spectacle</a>.</p>

<h3>Construction</h3>

<p>We set out to create an environment that could physically envelope a participant. The key technical challenge was building a space big enough for a human. We investigated using sewer pipe and telephone kiosks - eventually we decided to build the &#8220;vessel&#8221; for ourselves.&nbsp; We constructed a 4 feet x 4 feet by 6 feet &#8220;vessel&#8221; and used steel cables and rigging to suspend it from the lighting grid at ITP.</p>

<p>Originally, we thought that making this an automated/self-directed experience made sense - but we were keen to avoid complex technologies, sensors etc. The more we thought about having to interact with the participant directly, the more we liked the idea - the experience would remain personal and individual, but be directed from outside; this seemed appropriate. We added a layer of inflatable seating/bedding to the inside of the vessel, inflated by two high-powered electric air pumps.</p>

<h3>Forever</h3>

<p>Forever is an interactive art installation. The participant is asked to put on ear-protection and dark glasses. The participant enters a large vessel which is suspended from the ceiling. Two operators use pumps to inflate the interior walls of the vessel around the participant. After a period of time the walls are deflated and the participant exits. The next person is made ready, and enters the vessel.</p>

<h3>Response</h3>

<p>We were asked to reflect on the project. We chose to make an audio recording of our thoughts about the project. The recording was made on the 14th November 2011, one month before the ITP Winter Show.</p>
