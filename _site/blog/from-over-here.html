<p>### Update - 15th March 2011</p>
<p class="update">I'm very proud that From Over Here <a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/from_over_here_a_physical_representation_of_news_mentions_18793.asp" title="got a great writeup">got a great writeup</a> on the design site Core77. Pleased as pie. 

### Update - 16th March 2011
<p class="update">Thank you also Infosthetics.com for <a href="http://infosthetics.com/archives/2011/03/from_over_here_a_physical_representation_of_news.html" title="writing about the project">writing about the project</a>; one of my favourite design blogs!

From Over Here was created for the Data Representation class at ITP, taught by <a href="http://www.blprnt.com" title="Jer Thorp">Jer Thorp</a>. You'll find <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/sets/72157626087196057/with/5504555642/" title="more photos and video of the project here">more photos and video of the project here</a>.

### Concept
I wanted to create **a tangible, physical representation of the way Ireland is covered in the New York Times** - something that would answer some questions for me; **when has Ireland been covered, how has the amount of coverage changed over time, what have articles been about and who has been featured/mentioned in those articles .**

I wanted to build the data returned by the Times API into **a topography (like contour layers from a map) that could be added or removed by the viewer** - allowing them to step through time. After a couple of experiments I realised that the shape of the contours would be hard to generate programatically, and hard to fabricate - I opted to keep the core concept; physical layers of time that can be manipulated by the viewer - but using a more manageable shape. 

### Construction
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5506421196/" title="Laser Template by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5098/5506421196_eb1fe9ab48_b.jpg" class="photo" alt="Laser Template" /></a><br />
I used Processing to query the New York Times API and **render a graphic for each month of data returned**. These graphics were exported as individual pages of a PDF, and then these shapes were laid out for cutting by a laser cutter. 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5504547948/" title="From Over Here - Month Cards by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5091/5504547948_08ded1bcab.jpg" class="photo" alt="From Over Here - Month Cards" /></a>

This programming and preparation took 3-4 days and the laser cutting took 8 hours. Once the cards had all been cut they were stacked onto a wooden rod which was capped to keep them in place. 

### Results
<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/20723512?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=f0e563" width="699" height="393" frameborder="0"> </iframe><a href="http://vimeo.com/20723512">From Over Here</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/paulmay">Paul May</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.

I am very happy with the quality of the final project; it's aesthetically pleasing, satisfying to use and it's actually good at communicating patterns of coverage over time; the information etched onto the cards give a really interesting view of 18 years of Irish life from an external perspective. It's not surprising that Ireland's recent financial problems have prompted the most extensive coverage seen between 1992-2010.
