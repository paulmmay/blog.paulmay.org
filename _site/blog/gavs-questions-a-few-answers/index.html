<p>Thanks to Gavin for his generous donation (the first I've gotten through the website). In answer to his questions; I'm training with <a title="Piranha Triathlon Club" href="http://www.piranhatri.com" target="_top">Piranha Tri Club</a> here in Dublin, so I'm following their core training and working to a 20 week training plan which I cobbled together from information at <a href="http://www.triathlonireland.com" target="_top">Triathlon Ireland</a>, <a href="http://www.trinewbies.com" target="_top">TriNewbies</a> and <a href="http://www.beginnertriathlete.com" target="_top">Begginer Triathlete</a>, as well as advice from other people who've done Triathlons before.</p>

<p>I train (bike, run) using a Polar F6 heart-rate monitor. This is a fairly basic model available widely on eBay and in Argos. The HRM is basically a chest-strap which picks up my heartbeat and then sends the data to a wrist watch. The watch records the data, and gives me min-max heart rate zones for an effective training session. This has been really good in helping me make sure I don't hurt myself while training. The inclination is to go at it like a bull in a china shop, but the heart rate monitor keeps me from overdoing it.</p>

<p>The swimming training is all coached, and usually consists of a 200m warm-up, and then a series of drills taken in 25m/50m sections. A typical hour at the moment is probably 800-900m, and it feels <em>way</em> longer than that. For the first few months the coaching focuses on technique, and then moves onto more advanced endurance, time-improvement. My focus is obviously just getting to a level of fitness and technique where 1500m isn't a problem (at the moment it definitely is).</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope they're decent answers. My back is still very sore, but hopefully some physio therapy in the next few days will help me with that.</p>
