<p class="intro">Getting into debt while in college is the easiest thing in the world; the friendly people are only too happy to let you take the small loan you took out to travel, or to fund a project, or do whatever and increase it a couple of times - because they're just <em>so</em> nice. </p>


<p>Recently I've moved to a lovely new house in Booterstown. The house is great great great, I love it. I especially love being able to cycle to work, and I especially love not having to trudge home all the way through town every evening. It's great - I highly recommend never commuting to where you work if at all possible.</p>

<p>On the downside though; I now live pretty far away from swimming, so I've been to training exactly once in two months. My excuse is that getting up at 5.45 am to get a 6.06am train to go swimming would probably not be something I could keep up twice a week indefinitely, so I'll have to figure something else out. I don't drive a car, and buying one so I can go swimming might be a bit drastic.</p>

<p>My main piece of news is that I'm now practically debt free. Take that student loan! Seriously, getting into debt while in college is the easiest thing in the world; the friendly people are only too happy to let you take the small loan you took out to travel, or to fund a project, or do whatever and increase it a couple of times - because they're just so nice. My time in the Students' Union was a real learning experience (personally and professionally), but it also didn't pay a lot and I found myself drawing on the loan to pay for things that I really shouldn't have. Anyway, to cut a long story short I've spent that last 14 months putting some money aside each month into a company shares scheme. I sold my shares last week and had enough to pay off my student loan with about 100 quid left over to go crazy with. It's a huge weight off my shoulders. Beware student banks bearing gifts.</p>
