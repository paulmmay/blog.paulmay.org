		<p class="intro">My legs were a bit stiff after the bag-packing last night; but the swimming went well today. When the coach told me to do a 200m warm-up I wasn't totally phased, but it was still a tough all-in-all. This week I was joined by Ed in the "technique" (beginner) lane, so it was good to have another person at a similar level. </p>


<p>So, that's all the training for today. A run tomorrow, and then Sunday off. Back to it on Monday, and more swimming on Tuesday. Happy Easter to you all.</p>
