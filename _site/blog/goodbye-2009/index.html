<p class="intro">2009 - the year when we got engaged, moved in together, "acquired" a new car, scuba-dived and did lots more besides. Here's my roundup of a memorable year. </p>


<h3>January - Engaged, Anne</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/3181556907/" title="Engagement Present by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3449/3181556907_c62ea10d2b_t.jpg"  alt="Engagement Present" class="smallflickr"/></a>We spent New Year's 2008/2009 in the company of Ciaran Vipond and Jane Chadwick in Amsterdam - and the New Year was only a day old when <strong>I asked Cliona to marry me</strong>, right there in Ciaran and Jane's living room. Cliona said yes, thankfully, and even bought me a Macbook as an engagement present, what a woman!&nbsp; (Cliona, I'm using a photo of the Macbook here, not because I'm getting married to it - but because you feature quite heavily over the next 12 months).</p>

<p>In January <strong>we lost my aunty Anne</strong>; who was an incredibly special person; a fabulous aunty (more like another mum) to me, my brother and sister - also an amazing wife, mother, grandmother, friend. She rocked, and no mistake. I am incredibly grateful for having known her.</p>

<h3>February - Cliona's Graduation</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/3276788599/" title="The Graduate by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3438/3276788599_e090f705df_t.jpg"  alt="The Graduate"  class="smallflickr"/></a>In February Cliona <strong>graduated from her M.Sc. in Pharmaceutical Analysis </strong>from Trinity. She is a smartie. I got to attend the graduation ceremony, which - because it's Trinity - was conducted through the hip and upcoming tongue of &#8220;latin&#8221;. Fair play to you Trinity, you know how to party.</p>

<h3>March - Scanning</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/2328279109/" title="1984spain0003 copy 2 by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3134/2328279109_6c1a30ed62_t.jpg"  alt="1984spain0003 copy 2" class="smallflickr" /></a>In March I finally finished scanning <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/sets/72157604104523601/" title="hundreds and hundreds of family photos">hundreds and hundreds of family photos</a> that had been sitting in boxes for years, and which - surprisingly given most them are only a couple of decades old, had started to fade away. This was a bit a herculean task, but of course since then I've discovered all the ways you can do this type of thing incredibly quickly.</p>

<h3>April - San Francisco</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/3431822836/" title="Jeff Veen by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3403/3431822836_e34b2aa0f1_t.jpg" alt="Jeff Veen"  class="smallflickr"/></a> In April I spent <strong>a glorious week in San Francisco</strong> at the Web 2.0 Expo; a conference for nerds like me who are trying make the web more like this (points to efficient, pleasurable, fascinating, educational pile of something awesome) and less like this (points towards difficult to use, unengaging pile of pants).</p>

<h3>May - TriAthy</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/3580268969/" title="TriAthy - Sprint Wave 7 Swim Start by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3309/3580268969_c81624d35a_t.jpg" alt="TriAthy - Sprint Wave 7 Swim Start"  class="smallflickr"/></a>In May I sucked, completely, at my only Triathlon of the year; TriAthy. I nearly had my jaw broken in the swim start, which didn't help. Lack of winter miles made for absence of summer smiles.</p>

<h3>June - Malta, Car</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/3657736802/" title="Man, Car, Dog by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3583/3657736802_c32c8ab333_t.jpg"  alt="Man, Car, Dog" class="smallflickr" /></a>June was completely jam-packed. We had an amazing holiday in Malta replete with relaxation, scuba-diving, snorkelling, and of course much <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g230152-d1051180-Reviews-Giuseppi_s-Mellieha_Island_of_Malta.html" title="eating">eating</a> up a storm.</p>

<p>We were lucky enough to be given, yes given, a car in June too. The car had been sitting idle in one of Cliona's neighbour's farm buildings - he offered it to Cliona's dad for parts, and he then gave it to us in one big, perfectly driveable part. Since then we've been <strong>learning how to drive</strong> and generally loving the freedom the car has given us. It rocks. (I still love you <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/1442951060/" title="bicycle">bicycle</a>, I promise)</p>

<h3>July - Raining</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/3756953067/" title="Me by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2464/3756953067_7eb3fa2616_t.jpg"  alt="Me" class="smallflickr" /></a>It <a href="http://www.met.ie/climate/monthly_summarys/jul09sum.pdf" title="Met Eireann summary for July 2009 (PDF)">rained, rained, rained</a> in July. We spent a day at the quirky, awesome Knockanstockan festival seeing our good friends <a href="http://www.myspace.com/veronariots" title="Verona Riots">Verona Riots</a> (who had their best year ever in 2009). In July my <a href="http://www.designbyfront.com" title="Front">Front</a> colleague Patsy Lagan completed Triathlone, which made me more than a little bit proud; a great achievement.</p>

<h3>August - MacMillan Street Party</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/3871745590/" title="Sue, Jane by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2496/3871745590_1783e3d3e7_t.jpg"  alt="Sue, Jane" class="smallflickr" /></a>In August we helped out at my cousin Annette's <strong>Macmillan Street Party</strong>; raising a stack load of cash for the cancer charity. I like to think that my efforts on the burger stand were pivotal to the success of the day.</p>

<h3>September - New Home</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/4215925196/" title="Family on Deck by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2656/4215925196_894680d790_t.jpg" alt="Family on Deck" class="smallflickr" /></a>In September we paid a surprise visit to see Kevin Cannon in Copenhagen, and caught the end of his show at <a href="http://ciid.dk/" title="CIID">CIID</a>.</p>

<p>During the summer I arranged with Front to spend more time in Dublin, and the changes kicked in from the end of September. Me and Cliona <strong>found a lovely new home</strong> on one of the coolest Georgian streets in Dublin, a stone's throw from where Cliona used to live on Parnell St. This is the first place we've ever rented together, and apart from being a lovely apartment, just being in Dublin more has changed our lives.</p>

<h3>October - All Moved In</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/4215993636/" title="Cowgirl Cliona - Landscape by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4051/4215993636_bc7436d018_t.jpg"  alt="Cowgifl Cliona - Landscape" class="smallflickr"/></a>We <strong>moved</strong> into the new apartment completely, properly in October. We attended Paul McKeever's wedding in Belfast, and got all dressed up for Halloween.</p>

<h3>November - That Goal</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/4109043564/" title="Snoopy by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2519/4109043564_74df743bfe_t.jpg" alt="Snoopy" class="smallflickr"/></a>In November I turned 29, and spent a lot of the month travelling with work. During the first few weeks of the month I took practically no photos - which is always the sign that I'm having zero fun at all. Ireland were <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/soccer/2009/1118/1224259099215.html" title="cheated out of a summer of footballing adventures">cheated out of a summer of footballing adventures</a>, but the month ended on a high as <strong>we confirmed the venue for our wedding</strong> next May.</p>

<h3>December - Christmas in Longford</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/4216129008/" title="Snowy Longford by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/4216129008_da8ac818f3_t.jpg" width="100" height="67" alt="Snowy Longford" class="smallflickr"/></a>I was <strong>sick as a parrot </strong>in the first week of December, spending a week in bed sipping fluids and generally feeling rough. Since getting better I've been working hard in work on some new projects, and getting ready for Christmas.</p>

<p>We had the pleasure of having the <strong>Gardiner Street Gospel Choir </strong>over to our house for their post-Christmas-party shindig, which was a lot of fun.</p>

<p>I'm spending <strong>Christmas outside of Dublin</strong> for the first time ever, enjoying the crispy cold down in Longford. We'll be back to Dublin in time for New Year's Eve, ready to kick off another year.</p>

<h3>2010</h3>

<p>2009 was a memorable year. We'll all miss my aunty Anne terribly, but we're <strong>looking forward to a great 2010</strong>; Simon will be home in January for the first time in 2 years. We're getting married in May, and thinking about plans for the future - who knows what time will bring. Hopefully all good things.</p>
