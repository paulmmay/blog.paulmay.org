<p>In a couple of hours we head to the airport, bound for Costa Rica, then Iceland - a gentle transition out of life in New York to something new. We are moving on after three amazing years.</p>

<p>The category of visa we have requires us to leave the US two years, before being eligible to stay for longer. I am not going to riff on the contradictions of the J visa right now, but it's fair to say that we wouldn't leave New York if we didn't have to. We are thriving here, and we both have a lot more to contribute to this great city.</p>

<p>We leave behind our places, routines, hobbies, and most importantly - our family, and our wonderful friends. We will miss them all. We know that it's more than possible to stay connected to them from afar, it'll just take a little more work. I am going to try to treat the distance as a fun challenge, and maybe as an opportunity to do some fun projects related to interaction at a distance.</p>

<p>Our destination, at least in the medium term, is London. I'm going to continue working on design projects related to healthcare and computation for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and I'm really delighted about this. I love my job. Cliona is looking for opportunities in biotech.</p>

<p>Honestly, I am not at the point where I'm excited about being in a new city, but I'll get there.</p>

<p>New York, friends and family - thank you so much for a great three years. We love you all.</p>
