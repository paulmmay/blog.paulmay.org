		<p>With the arrival of a new media form, the language used to describe it is always that of preceding media. With the arrival of film, critics used artistic and literary theories to analyse this new medium. Narratology, semiotics and classical art theory were applied to form and content, analysing narrative, symbolism and frame composition. The mise-en-scene, which had previously been known as a nineteenth century theatrical term describing the elements to be put on stage, now came to mean the elements placed into the frame of the cinema camera. In short, the terms used to describe dominant, established media are applied to new media, until perhaps better terms befitting that new medium evolve. New forms do not always replace old forms, nor new language old language.</p>

<p>However, there are inherent problems when applying existing media theory terms to new media. Just as semiotics was criticised for “linguistic bias” (Manovich, p.29) in the 70’s when it was being applied to film, the danger of pigeon holing a new medium in old language is ever present when discussing these new forms. There must always be a balance between established, appropriate theory, while leaving room for new language, and new expressions on new media to evolve. It is critically important that new media, and in the case of this essay, computer games, are not held to legitimate themselves under the terms of old media. To describe games, important cultural expressions<span class="super">1</span> in their own right, using a post-modern soup of pre-existing terms, is not only dangerous and elitist, it serves to delegitimate innovation, and promote a lazy relativism where new, better language is lost in a haze of nonsense.</p>

<p>It is with in this context that this essay should be viewed. The essay will analyse Half-Life, by Valve Software, one of the most popular and engaging computer games of the last five years. The essay will try to show how elements of the game can be read under relevant film-art headings, while viewing its form as a discreet entity in its own right, and showing that is also fits with a broader tradition of engaging story telling.</p>

<p>While the first-person perspective game has its origins in titles such as Battlezone and 3D Monster Maze which were released in the early 1980’s, it was not until the development of more sophisticated 3-D games engines, as well as powerful, affordable home computers in the early 1990’s, that the first-person genre began to take on the immersive, engaging form. Developed by id Software, Castle Wolfenstein 3-D, heralded the beginning of massive developments in 3-D gaming technology. For the first time, users were free to explore a detailed three-dimensional level from a first person point of view, completing goals and overcoming enemies. This format would be developed further in Doom, and then in the Quake series of games.</p>

<p>Half-Life was developed using the spatial graphics engine of the game Quake 2, and while the Doom and Quake games had expanded the concept of interactive 3D world building, Half-Life took this format and applied a cinematic feel, and more importantly, engaging plot progression and character development.<span class="super">2</span></p>

<figcaption>Plate 1 – The game's title fades out, and we see a moving, kino-eye style progression through an underground system of chambers. An announcer welcomes us to Black Mesa.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The game opens with a slow, cinematic fade-in. We are presented with a moving vista, a full screen view of a train moving through a subterranean world, as the voice of an announcer welcomes us to the Black Mesa Research facility (Plate 1). As the view cascades by, credits fade in and out giving the names of the game’s developers. This opening of the game is clearly cinematic introduction to the game environment. We could be watching the opening titles of a science fiction film. However, as the opening progresses, it becomes clear that this is not a static, non-interactive cut-scene; this is part of the game. By manipulating the game controls, the user sees that they are free to explore the restricted environment of the monorail carriage (Plate 2).</p>

<figcaption>￼Plate 2 – As the credits fade in and out (bottom left), we become aware that the view is not a cut-scene, but a first-person view from the monorail. We are free to explore the cabin.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The view is, therefore, transformed from the kino-eye of an opening credits sequence, to an interactive, first-person view. This fusion of cinematic and interactive is highly effective. What appears at first to be a closed, non-diagetically narrated sequence of video, becomes the character’s journey to work, with announcements being played over the train speaker system. What appears to be the view of an anonymous camera, becomes the literal view through which the user sees the game environment.</p>

<p>While the visual transformation from a static shot to dynamic, interactive view takes place, the acoustic elements, including the announcer, embed the user in a temporal and spatial locale. The character/user is surrounded by the diagetic, ambient sound as it rumbles along the rails and reverberates around the caves and caverns of Black Mesa. The non-diagetic announcer serves both as a narrator and introducer to the game-world, but also anchors the user in a temporal space, saying “Good Morning and welcome to the Black Mesa Transit System. This train is provided for the security and convenience of Black Mesa research personnel. The time is 8.49am. Current top- side temperature is 105 degrees. This train is inbound to sector C test facilities.” Again, this is a combination of what Chion would call acousmatic sound, sound which is heard without seeing its origin (Chion, p.71), and the gaming convention of locating the user within a character by using either text or images; the back story as it were. Using this sound we learn that Black Mesa is a research centre, and that the character is Gordon Freeman, a research technician, with a doctorate in physics from MIT.</p>

<p>Bordwell describes how film often appeals to the innate reactions of the spectator, such as a fear of darkness, and how this links the emotions of the spectator to the form of the film (Bordwell, p.29).</p>

<p>The implications of this cinematic trait on Half-Life are clear; users interact with a world which is both within their control, and at the same time, an illusion on a screen. Using this combination of both cinematic visual cues and interactive acoustic and visual forms, we are presented with a game-world identity, and are swept, quite literally into the game environment, and the story; the acoustic elements reflect the cinematic ideas of diagetic ambience, and non-diagetic narration, while at the same time locating the user in both identity and space. The visual cues and styles meld a cinematic opening with a three dimensional world.</p>

<p>This dramatic fusion of the cinematic and the interactive is made even more effective by the reduction in the amount of, for want a better term, cultural noise. Film is a culturally encoded finite, text, and is based around the norms of the writer and director (Bordwell, p.33). There is therefore, a certain cultural divide to overcome when interpreting any film.</p>

<p>Within the game environment however, the user has unlimited time, and within a game like Half-Life, an open environment, within which to build a conceptual model of the nature of the text. The interpretation of the interactive text is therefore, based to a large degree, on the exploration and subjective nature of the user, rather than the encoded norms of the film-maker. Users explore and build knowledge of their game-identity and the game-world. The game designers provide the environment through which the nature of the text can be encoded, but it is up to the user to receive and interpret this information in whatever order and at whatever pace they feel comfortable with. The power of the gaming environment as a storytelling medium is clear; basing the nature of the text on both the nature of the encoders, and to a large degree, on the nature of the receivers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before reaching the end of the game narrative, the player must visit most of [the game-space], uncovering its geometry and topology, learning its logic and its secrets. (Manovich, p.245)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is story telling through active participation. Half-Life introduces character and location using cinematic conventions, but then breaks them to introduce the user to the interactive environment.</p>

<figcaption>Plate 3 – The security guard and scientist address you as Dr. Freeman, and advise you to proceed to the test chamber. The role-playing, first person genre is dramatically enhanced by interactions with computer generated characters who reinforce the user's game identity.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The opening of Half-Life locates the user in the temporal and physical frameworks of the game world. As the user/character leaves the train, they are addressed as Dr. Freeman (Plate 3). Through exploration, we discover that Freeman is about to conduct an experiment, and following instructions from computer controlled characters, we initiate the chain of events that propel the story onwards. Freeman’s experiment goes badly wrong (Plate 4), there is a huge explosion and a dimensional portal to a strange alien world opens, allowing aliens and monsters to flood into the research facility (Plate 5).</p>

<p>Spurred on by roaring, non-diagetic alarms and explosions, the first reaction of the user is to escape the facility, to escape from danger. Again, the text uses the innate fears of the user to propel the story. This is the premise for the main act of the game. Superficially, the user must escape to freedom, but as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that there are forces at play which are trying to stop this happening. The causal structure of the piece dramatically shifts from a science fiction story, to a conspiratorial piece with supernatural interventions.<span class="super">3</span> This structure can be found in many films, and is a mainstay of classical narrative structures (Bordwell, p.86). For example, in the Wizard of Oz, the seemingly dramatic turning point of the tornado initiates Dorothy’s real dramatic journey into the supernatural. Half-Life therefore, uses cinematic structures enhanced with interactivity to present an emotive, engaging experience.</p>

<p>The “hero’s journey” story which unfolds, while akin to a science fiction cinematic style, also relates strongly to more fundamental underlying structures. As the character progresses, he is confronted by military personnel who are removing evidence of the accident. More importantly, we see the soldiers being orchestrated by shadowy figures dressed in black. Freeman is confronted by these agents on several occasions, but they are always at a distance, or behind glass. The simple causal structure has now become one where the characters destiny is controlled by supernatural forces, a dominant trait of classical dramatic structures. In Homer’s Odyssey, the gods continually intervene in the fate of Odysseus, as when Poseidon sends a storm to slow Odysseus’ path<span class="super">4</span> and when Athena saves the hero from drowning.<span class="super">5</span> There are therefore, thematic parallels between the journey of the protagonist in Half-Life, and that of the heroes of the classical literature which underlies the structure of the classic film form.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast to modern literature, theater and cinema, which are built around the psychological tensions between characters and movement in psychological space, these computer games return us to ancient forms of narrative in which the plot is driven by the spatial movement of the main hero. (Manovich, p.246)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There exists in Half-Life therefore, a melding of structures from science fiction literature (dimensional shifts, alien invaders), cinematic convention (kino-eye, credit sequences, causal relationships, cinematic engagement with the innate fears and anxieties as described by Bordwell) as well as a spatial and thematic structure which parallels classical literature; the hero’s journey through time and space, while under the influence of unseen agents.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>In Half-Life, cinematic conventions of story telling, acoustic and visual immersion, act structure, kino-eye camera movements, transitions and fades, and cast/crew credits are overlaid with a rich combination of an engaging story, and a classical journey from the world of the natural, to a supernatural realm of conspiracy and intrigue.</p>

<p>This essay has presented a significant cultural artefact using some of the headings of film art, while at the same time, trying to describe the piece under the still evolving terms of immersive interactive media. Using the theories of David Bordwell, Lev Manovich and Michel Chion, supported by the ancient writings of Homer which include many aspects of classical narrative structure, both the form and content of the piece have been analysed.</p>

<p>It is the author’s conviction that the language of cinema can be paralleled to an extent with some elements of new media theory, and at the same time, the new media elements can reflect a much older tradition of story telling.</p>

<p>It is hoped that in time, through analysis and theorising, a new language of interactive media will evolve, one which encompasses the parallels between new and old media, and at the same time, one which will give voice to the distinct cultural relevance of new media forms.</p>

  <li>The British computer game market has been worth at least 40% more than the total cinema box-office receipts in that country since 1997, the same year that there were more computer games sold in the United States than books (Poole, p.20). These simple economic facts demonstrate the level to which computer games are already established as cultural expressions</li>
