<p>I've had a cool few days! Went to see the Jerry Springer show on Tuesday, and was sitting in the front row. It was a very strange experience; part circus, part tragedy, part ultimate fighting championship. The audience was coached on how to boo and cheer the comedy villains on stage, and the first two, seemingly fake segments, lead into other seemingly real guests confessing horrible secrets to their families. All the time we booed and cheered like jackals. I wish I could tell you that I wasn't drawn into it, but I was chanting along with the rest of them. All in all it was very strange. That's all I can call it.</p>

<p>I leave for San Francisco in a few days, I can't wait! My pizza is burning and I have to go to work.</p>
