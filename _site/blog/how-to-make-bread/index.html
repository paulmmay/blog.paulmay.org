		<p class="intro">Each week at our Applications class we hear from a guest speaker, and a group of students respond to the speaker from the previous week. We heard from, then reacted to Doug Rushkoff's talk about his new book, Program or be Programmed.

<p>### The Talk
Rushkoff’s main point was that at a time when so much of our lives are influenced by, and mediated by digital technology it’s important to foster a sense of curiosity, exploration, questioning and understanding of digital systems. Simplistically, <strong>we need to understand the biases, traits and construction of tools like social networks so that we can make good decisions</strong> and maintain independence of thought and action - basically so we don’t get lead up the garden path by marketers and evil-doers. The other main point that I took away from his talk was his <strong>advocacy for a peer-to-peer system of value</strong> tied to effort, not arbitrary financial values - which as we’ve seen are built on somewhat flimsy ground.</p>

<h3 id="reaction">Reaction</h3>
<p>The group - me, Fernanda Bak, Noah Crowley, Cyrus Von Hochstetter and Yoonjo Shin - all lovely people - talked extensively about Rushkoff’s ideas. To be honest, <strong>we didn’t feel that he was saying anything massively novel</strong> - it was common sense to us that <strong>people should understand as much of the world they live in as possible</strong>, but that people’s interests would obviously dictate what parts of the world they seek to understand.</p>

<p>We didn’t really need to prove that <strong>the system of currency and finance that has been created up until now is open for abuse and manipulation</strong> - other people have made that point eminently on our behalf.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-amp-presentation">Implementation &amp; Presentation</h3>

<p>We decided to demonstrate a simple skill, how to make bread, as <strong>an example of the value of understanding a system/the world around us</strong> and the <strong>exchange of a skill/value between people</strong>.</p>

<p>We would also create <strong>an opportunity and a system for people in our class, who otherwise might not know that their peers have particular skills, to talk and share simple skills.</strong> In essence, we wanted our presentation to <strong>roll the two main points of his talk</strong> and show how achievable (and in a sense normal/common-sensible) they are.</p>

<p>We got together at my house, and I showed the group <strong>how to make a simple yeast bread</strong>. We filmed the process, and talked about how it related to the talk. We then designed a card-trading mechanic for the class, and set up a simple shared spreadsheet where skills could be offered or requested.</p>

<p>On the day of our presentation <strong>we showed our short film to the rest of the class - which got a good reaction</strong>. We handed out <strong>cards for people to write down their skill to exchange with others</strong> and gave a simple demo of what we wanted people to do. <br />

As a final piece of the presentation we** asked everybody to go to a shared spreadsheet to document skills that they could offer others, and what they themselves wanted to learn** - creating a resource of 140 skills on offer or in demand.</p>

<p>So, that’s it - it was a very busy week between Rushkoff’s talk and the presentation, but I’m proud of the results.</p>
