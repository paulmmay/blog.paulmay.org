<p class="intro">We shared some great times, but things are so much simpler now. Let me explain.</p>


<p>I know that if you read this you'll be annoyed.</p>

<p>I left you on the arm of my chair in the cinema, and by the time I was a few steps away you were gone. The man checked in the office, he checked in the box. He took my name and wrote it down carefully. I called the next day. Any sign? No.</p>

<p>I was careless and then you were gone; that's six months ago now.</p>

<p>At first it was weird - being without you. No Radiolab on the train. No e-mail on the go. No tweets. No check-ins. No to-do list. I visit again in the land of the phone call and the text message, the post card and the passenger pigeon.</p>

<p>But over time I've learned to cope without you.</p>

<p>I started to read again, yes read, on the train. Real books, paper. Those books I bought, I have now read most of them. The tweets I send and then regret later because, really, I need to lighten the hell up - I send at least 50% less of those than before. Those things I have to do, well I still don't do the same amount of them.&nbsp; Now I save seconds by not needing to check the ones I actually do off a list. When I am gone from work, from school, from there and them - I am gone.</p>

<p>You were great iPhone, the freebased nicotine peak of 25 years of computer usage. I can't say it wasn't fun.</p>

<p>I don't miss you. There. I said it.</p>
