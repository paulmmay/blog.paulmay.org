Today we took a trip to the <a href="http://www.brooklynhistory.org" title="Brooklyn Historical Society">Brooklyn Historical Society</a>'s exhibition <em>In Our Own Words: Portraits of Brooklyn's Vietnam Veterans</em>. </p>


<p>The exhibition presents the stories of 12 veterans of the Vietnam War who were all born in Brooklyn. Each veteran is shown in a near life-size portrait and while looking at the portrait you hear an interview with the veteran played through directional speakers. There are also photos, personal belongings and transcripts of longer interviews.</p>

<p>I found the exhibition <strong>a little frustrating</strong> - the audio quality was really poor, and the editing of the interviews was ruthless (and sometimes arbitrary) - to the point where they felt disjointed. In most cases, the curators had prioritised stories of what had happened to the veteran in Vietnam, but there was very little context about their lives, the cause of the war or the aftermath when they came back to Brooklyn. Even as somebody with very little knowledge about the war, I came away having learned very little.</p>

<p><strong>Another problem was the diversity of perspectives or lack thereof</strong>. All but one of the participants were male Americans, the other was a female American nurse - and her story revolved around an injury suffered by a soldier in her care.&nbsp; There was no real perspective on the war from the point of view of families, people who objected and didn't fight, or Vietnamese people.</p>

<p>Yes, the title of the exhibition is &#8220;Portraits of Brooklyn's Vietnam Veterans&#8221; but<strong> to take such a literal interpretation of such a complicated period of history felt artificial/exclusive</strong>. Between the selection of the subjects, the editing of their interviews and the presentation of each individual in a massive gilded frame - it felt as though the curators were trying to offer a cartoon of heroism, of service to country; not necessarily wrong, but not a nuanced story.</p>

<p>Anyway, despite the exhibition's flaws - It was a real pleasure to get to take a trip outside of ITP with a whole class; we even had time for a beer afterwards. Next week's field-trip is to the <a href="http://www.tenement.org" title="New York City Tenement Museum">New York City Tenement Museum</a>.</p>
