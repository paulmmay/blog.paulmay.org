<h1><a href="/blog/audio-information-extraction">Extracting Information from Sound</a></h1>
<p class="datetime">31 July 2016</p>
</div></div>

<div class="wrapper main">
<div class="left content">
<p>I’m working on a new information retrieval and machine learning project - but unlike previous projects that involved large amounts of text, this project involves sound.</p>

<p>My goal is to create a small, self-contained robot that can listen to, and learn from its surroundings - building up sonic fingerprints of a number of locations. Later, it should be possible for the robot to tell what location it’s at, simply by listening, and comparing it what it hears to previous experiences.</p>

<p>I’m just getting started with the project, and my focus is on writing simple software that can record sound, extract features, fit machine learning models, then classify previously unheard sound.</p>

<p>The field of audio/music information retrieval is very well-developed, so I have a lot to read and learn from.</p>

<p>As a simple hello-world, I took two existing sound files; a Mozart piano sonata, and a recent track by Rihanna, and visualized them as <a href="&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_feature&quot;">chromagrams</a>. Visually, the difference between the two tracks is clear, and this might be a clue that the notes used in a piece of music represent useful features for a machine learning model. I’ve yet to discover if this is the case, or if chromatic features are useful for more ambient sound.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that, for now, I’m foregoing any thought of using deep learning techniques to create vector representations of sound, for use in classification tasks. I might try to tackle this down the road. Crawl, walk, run etc.</p>

<p>I’ll write up what I find as the project continues.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/simon-grad-nyc-progress">Graduation</a></h1>
<p class="datetime">05 September 2014</p>

<p>It’s been a very busy, and very important few weeks. Last week I had the great honour to watch <a href="http://chicago.academia.edu/SimonMay">my brother</a> graduate from University of Chicago with a PhD in Anthropology. I am so proud of him. It takes a lot of hard work to tackle a complex project spanning many years, but he did it.</p>

<p>After the graduation I spent some time in New York, catching up with the team at Sloan Kettering. Our projects have been challenging, and not without some major bumps in the road, but this week things became simpler, and better. The feedback from the eventual users of our work is very positive. We’re definitely on a fruitful path, and we’ve been given permission to make our work as good as it needs to be. It feels like this week marked the crossing of some important threshold.</p>

<p>I also got to spend some time with my New York friends, who I miss quite a bit. It’s so cool to be able to come back, spend time with them, and hear about all their lives and their work. They’re building new devices, designing interfaces, writing software, building automata, writing about technology, and making all sorts of things work a little better. They are all so eager to learn, make, and understand more. I feel really refreshed and inspired, because of them.</p>

<p>Also this week; <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/09/140903-galaxy-supercluster-map-laniakea-astronomy-science-ngspace/">some perspective</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Throughout the universe, galaxies tend to clump together in massive structures that astronomers call superclusters. According to the new map, Earth’s galaxy lives near the edge of the Laniakea supercluster, which measures 500 million light-years in diameter and includes roughly 100,000 galaxies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a few weeks, me and Cliona will introduce a new little person into this sea of infinity. I am excited to meet whomever arrives.</p>

<p>Last week I had the pleasure of attending some of the final student presentations and <a href="http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp13/courses/final-projects-2013/">end-of-year show</a> at the <a href="http://www.ciid.dk">Copenhagen Institute for Interaction Design</a>. Here are some of my favourite projects:</p>

<p>I also really liked:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp13/courses/final-projects-2013/hej_verden/">hej_verden</a> - A toolkit to help children learn computer programming.</li>
  <li><a href="http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp13/courses/final-projects-2013/little-treasures/">Little Treasures</a> - A thoroughly-designed service designed to teach children about the concept of value and the use of money.</li>

</ul>

<p>The work from CIID students was, as ever, thorough and thoughtful. It’s a great programme.</p>
