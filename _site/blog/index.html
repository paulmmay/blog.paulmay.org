<h2><a href="/blog/tom-sorell-on-surveillance">Tom Sorell on Surveillance</a></h2>


<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/tom-sorell-on-surveillance" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">02 February 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p>In the latest episode of the excellent <a href="http://philosophybites.com/2013/01/tom-sorell-on-surveillance.html">Philosophy Bites</a> podcast, philosopher Tom Sorell eloquently describes why surveillance-free spaces are important. Sorell is taking part in the <a href="http://www.surveille.eu/">Surveille project</a> that is examining the usage and ethics of surveillance in Europe.</p>

<blockquote><p>If one has to answer the question "what in general makes privacy valuable?" it may be that you need privacy in order to be an autonomous person.</p>

<p>Even to be you, you need a space of autonomous reflection, otherwise you might become the mouthpiece for the people around you. If you're never able to have this space that's afforded by the private mind, you just become a mouthpiece for the official view, or the views of your parents, or the views of your friendship group. You need a space in which you're able to put your own stamp on your beliefs, and that means coming up with reasons for them from your own point of view.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't agree with everything Sorell says (I <em>do</em> believe that the use of surveillance necessarily involves a power relationship), but what he has to say is thought-provoking. Surveillance is an important issue to consider, especially given the ubiquity of social software, connected cameras, and rapidly shifting norms around what constitutes public and private space. It's good to see the EU funding work like this.</p>

<div class="content"><p><a href="http://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> is a wonderful creative programming class taught at ITP by <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/">Dan Shiffman</a>. In The Nature of Code, students learn how to programme software applications that mimic nature in some way, covering topics like gravity, wind, flocking, learning and evolution. For my own final project I made <a href="https://vimeo.com/41397044">a little simulation</a> where creatures are born, flock, find food, react to danger, age and die.</p>

<p>The class was a real revelation for me. I wasn't good at maths or physics in school, and only really started to grasp concepts like trigonometry, vectors and forces in Dan's class. I really wish that a class like this (and more creative methods of teaching) had been available when I was much younger.</p>

<p>Dan has just <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0985930802/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0985930802&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=natureofcode-20">released a book</a> that covers, and expands upon, the content of the class. There's a freely available <a href="https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples">library of code</a> and Dan is <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/464686">recording a series of (highly entertaining) videos</a> to help students along.</p>

<h2><a href="/blog/uncompensated-design-challenges">Uncompensated Design Challenges</a></h2>


<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/uncompensated-design-challenges" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">24 January 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p>New York City has issued a design challenge called <a href="http://www.reinventpayphones.splashthat.com/">Reinvent Payphones</a> and has asked designers to think of new uses for the city's payphone infrastructure. I went along to the information session last night and was pretty disheartened. I just don't think that the approach being taken by the city will result in a good outcome for the city, or the designers who take part.</p>

<p>The start of a successful design project is a clear statement of need, a description of a context and some sense of what is expected - constraints. With Reinvent Payphones there is no clear statement of why the City needs or wants to reinvent payones other than the expiration of the current commercial payphone contracts.</p>

<p>The City can't offer any useful data about payphone usage, the role that the phones play in the life of the city, or the changing context.</p>

<p>They give <a href="http://www.reinventpayphones.splashthat.com/#nyc_nav">a list of things that are important</a>, but don't say which things are more important than others.</p>

<p>If the City was really invested in the outcome of the challenge then more care and attention should have been put into writing the brief; describing the context, offering useful data, stating a problem, setting clear goals - and then being flexible about the form of the solution (maybe a reinvented payphone isn't a reinvented payphone).</p>

<p>Next, there are the rules. Even though designers are encouraged to design and build prototypes, they will receive no compensation for their time or materials. They automatically give the city a free, perptetual license to use their work. A commercial procurement process for the development of a new payphone system will be run "completely separately". But, the City acknowledges that designers' ideas might be incorporated into that process. How is this fair?</p>

<p>Between the very poorly-stated brief and the harsh terms, Reinvent Payphones seems to boil down to the City using members of the design community to flesh out the requirements of a commerical contract, in return for some praise and publicity.</p>

<p>To me, this falls into the category of uncompensated design, or spec work, and it's disheartening to see a City like New York trawling for spec work. Here are just a few of my reasons why challenges like this are bad:</p>

<ol>
<li>Uncompensated design challenges are exploitative. When a company or organization with the wherewithal to offer compensation asks a designer to solve a problem and then give the solution to them for free, that is exploitative. Just because the organization arranges for the person to be praised in public for being such a good sport is irrelevant. Publicity is gratifying but it doesn't put food on the table.</li>
<li>Uncompensated design challenges reward the wrong thing. Is the design that gains the widest publicity the best design? Of course not. It's just the one optimized for maximum public acceptance.</li>
<li>Uncompensated design challenges are elitist. Uncompensated design challenges exclude people who have the most to gain from good design from the design process. The underserved and disadvantaged can't gamble their time on the promise of good vibes, or the possibility of a paying job down the road.</li>
</ol>


<p>If we take these few problems and run them over time, what do we get? We get a lot of designers doing work but only some living with dignity. We get a class of "successful" designers who live apart from the people who really need the products of good design. We get a design culture where people who shape reputations hold far more power than the people we design for. We optimise for designs that are "right" because they find favour. We separate designers from the context (and the "client") and expect them to just riff on ideas, as though that's the same thing as design.</p>

<p>I am not alone. Universities and professional associations urge caution around design challenges and spec work:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.design.cmu.edu/files/school_of_design_position_on_solicitations_for_competitions.pdf">The School of Design at Carnegie Mellon University</a>:  We discourage proposals for competitions because they are usually a solicitation of design concepts to be produced on a speculative basis by the professionals you are considering. We do not participate in, or promote projects that essentially ask students to design on 'spec'.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aiga.org/position-spec-work/">AIGA</a> believes that professional designers should be compensated fairly for their work and should negotiate the ownership or use rights of their intellectual and creative property through an engagement with clients. To that end, AIGA strongly encourages designers to enter into client projects with full engagement to show the value of their creative endeavor, and to be aware of all potential risks before entering into speculative work.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know that New York City can do better than this. I'd love to hear your thoughts about design challenges. Maybe you can think of ways to encourage participation without exploitation?</p>

<h2><a href="/blog/upstream-color">Upstream Color</a></h2>


<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/upstream-color" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">20 January 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8517/8400307938_80ea7a7188_b_d.jpg" alt="a still photo from Upstream Color. A man and a woman lie together, fully dressed in an empty bath tub" / class="photo">
I'm excited to see Shane Carruth's new film, <a href="http://www.shanecarruth.com/film/upstreamcolor">Upstream Color</a>. Carruth is the writer and director of one of my favourite films, <a href="http://www.shanecarruth/film/primer">Primer</a>. Made on a shoestring budget and released in 2004, Primer updates a well-worn mainstay of science fiction storytelling, the "time-machines are probably a bad idea" tale. The film's major innovation was to show, in ambitious detail, the practical and emotional burdens of time travel.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/53890508?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="700" height="394" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>As life for the two protagonists divides into a tangle of recursive, competing timelines we're asked to consider how complicated things would get if more people had access to the time machine. Like all time-machine stories, Primer is a moral fable about the limits of human imagination and the hazard of acting purely in self interest. It's an energetic, rich, and very rewarding film.</p>

<p>My hope is that Upstream Color comes close to being as entertaining as Primer. The press notes and trailer for the film are compelling in their vagueness:</p>

<blockquote><p>A man and woman are drawn together, entangled in the lifecycle of an ageless organism. Identity becomes an illusion as they struggle to assemble the loose fragments of wrecked lives.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upstream Color will be shown at the <a href="http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13010/upstream_color">Sundance Film Festival</a> next week before going on limited/guerrilla release in April.</p>

<div class="content"><iframe width="700" height="525" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/usQIoKoJSFM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>I am <em>really</em> enjoying Mark Cousins' series <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2044056/"><em>The Story of Film: An Odyssey</em></a> which is now available to stream on <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Story_of_Film_An_Odyssey/70261400?locale=en-US">Netflix</a>. It is a beautifully made documentary broken into 15, one hour-long episodes. <em>The Story of Film</em> traces the history of film from its birth through to the current day.</p>

<p>Unlike a lot of film historians, Cousins really goes out of his way to show examples of films from all over the world, like Yevgeni Bauer's <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0005916/">After Death</a></em> (<em>Posle Smerti</em>) from Russia, made in 1915 (above).</p>

<p>What really comes across is the rapid change that cinema underwent in the decades after its invention. By the time film was a couple of decades old it had been transformed from a curiosity into an art form. Fascination with the technology of filmmaking had been superseded by a fascination with new forms of storytelling enabled by technology.</p>

<p>By the 1920s filmmakers had formulated, refined and then deliberately subverted successive forms of film-making. The grammar of film was constantly being re-written and the result was innumerable, fascinating, deeply different films.</p>

<p>By comparison, today's cinema - and indeed all media - look timid and conformist. The web is about as old as cinema was during its heady days of experimentation and is becoming more cynical and homogenous each year. If the history of cinema tells us anything it's that we shouldn't be afraid to write a new rule book, or indeed to burn that rule book when things become too familiar.</p>

<p><em>The Story of Film: An Odyssey</em> is inspiring. It has put fire in my belly. I really recommend it.</p>

<div class="content"><p>What I find most disappointing about the recent statements from <a href="http://www.nni.ie/v2/broad/portal.php?content=../_includes/prportal.php&date=4th%20Jan%202013&year=2013">National Newspapers of Ireland</a> isn't that they assert that linking to a website could require licensing - that old chestnut is as old as the web itself. What is most disappointing is that it's a clear sign that the Irish news media have done very little to prepare for the opportunities that the web now offers them.</p>

<p>What we've seen in the last few weeks from NNI is old thinking -  an entrenched mindset that can't consider the value of content unbundled from a physical medium or an insular website. If hyperlinks are beyond the Irish news media's ken, what about complex economic issues, data-driven journalism, mobile computing, video journalism, blogging?</p>

<p>I contend that two decades is adequate time for any industry to hone the critical faculties, business models and skills made relevant by new technologies. Similarly, if you're a journalist and your skillset hasn't expanded to include an understanding of copyright, mass-participation in media production, ethics in the digital age, data analysis and online publishing then your window of relevance is probably going to be limited.</p>

<p>Let the newspapers that NNI represents keep pace with Irish people and contemporary society or let them die. No more holding back the seas.</p>

<p>The J Visa is a cruel mistress - you come for a while then you go for a while.

<p>In the documentary <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1424432/">Senna</a></em>, Ayrton Senna describes his mental state during the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix.</p>

<blockquote><p>That day I suddenly realised that I was no longer driving it conscious, and I was in a different dimension for me. The circuit for me was a tunnel, which I was just going, going going…and I realised I was well beyond my conscious understanding.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since watching the film this morning I've been thinking about human-machine interfaces (for the first time in a while). I wonder whether the type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi">experience</a> Senna describes requires an interface so simple that it melts into the background. What are the critical ingredients of an experience like this? When is an experience like this undesirable? These aren't new questions, but again - I have haven't thought about them in a while.</p>

<p class="footnote">Incidentally, in the race Senna built up a substantial lead over Alain Prost before crashing out on the 65th lap. </p>

<h2><a href="/blog/oliver-sacks-is-looking-for-indigo">Oliver Sacks is Looking for Indigo</a></h2>


<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/oliver-sacks-is-looking-for-indigo" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">11 November 2012</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p>In his talk at The Cooper Union last Friday, Oliver Sacks described his use of hallucinogenic drugs in his search for the colour indigo:</p>

<blockquote><p>There were many different motives; it was all a long time ago. It was all between '63 and '67. I had been puzzling about indigo. Indigo was inserted into the spectrum by Newton, so was orange; he felt there should be seven colours as there are seven notes in the musical scale, but it seemed to me that no two people agreed what indigo was like - and it was felt in fact that the pigment derived from the indigo plant was not really indigo. I decided I wanted to see indigo. I couldn't imagine it, but I thought I might be able to hallucinate it so I built a sort of pharmacological launchpad. A base of amphetamine, then some LSD, with a little cannabis on top. It got me fairly pickled; stoned is the right word.</p>

<p>When I felt ready I said "I want to see indigo <em>now!</em>" and as if thrown by a paintbrush, a trembling, pear-shaped blob of the most wonderful colour appeared on the wall. <em>Indigo</em>. It not only seemed wonderfully luminous, but it filled me with a sort of mystical - almost religious joy. I felt it was numinous as well as luminous, and although I'm an old Jewish atheist I thought "this is the colour of heaven" and I thought "this is the colour which Gioto tried to get but never could, and maybe this is a colour that no longer exists on the earth". And I leant forward in a sort of ecstasy and it vanished.</p>

<p>I felt very heartbroken, and in fact for months afterwards I would turn over little stones and things. I was looking for indigo.</p>

<p>I did experience it once again and that was when I came to New York in '65 I went to a concert in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the Egyptology gallery and in the first half of the concert there was some Monteverdi which transported me and it was sort of rapture. In the interval I wandered into the Egyptology gallery and saw there was some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_lazuli">lapis lazuli</a> amulets and so-forth and some of them were indigo and I thought "thank god - it exists in the world".</p>

<p>In the second half of the concert I didn't like the music much. I became a little bored and irritable, I thought I'd go and get a sip of indigo, but when I went back the lapis lazuli was just blue and mauve and puce and I've never seen indigo again.</p></blockquote>

<p>He finished the story:</p>

<blockquote><p>I knew it would have to be a blue of some sort. So I pre-determined it. I didn't say I want to see indigo and then see a splotch of orange. So I played a part, then it took this leap, helped by the launchpad, from imagination to hallucination.</p>

<p>Incidentally I'm not recommending the experience, although if you can get it from music, or from falling in love, or from medication, or from scenery - that's really a much better way. I'm glad I survived my drug period, many of my friends didn't.</p></blockquote>

<div class="content"><p>I had the pleasure of seeing <a href="http://www.oliversacks.com/">Dr. Oliver Sacks</a> in conversation with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hockenberry">John Hockenberry</a> at the Cooper Union last night. Sacks was speaking about his latest book <em>Hallucinations</em> as part of the <a href="http://worldsciencefestival.com/webcasts/sacks?/events/sacks">World Science Festival</a>. It was a really great event, not least because of John Hockenberry's stunning introduction:</p>

<blockquote><p>Tonight we're going to explore this notion of hallucinations. There's a really young crowd here. I hasten to say don't try this at home but I suspect many of you have. Oh well. Be that as it may. Let me tell you a little hallucination story here in this hall, where we might even get a glimpse of <a href="http://www.nps.gov/liho/historyculture/summary.htm">Abraham Lincoln</a> if we're lucky. All of New York this week is something of a hallucination. My neighborhood looks like Gaza. We're experiencing a sense of perceptual distortion from our encounters with the natural world this week.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about a young fellow who studied mathematics at the University of Chicago a couple of decades ago who had a predisposition for psilocybin mushrooms in the course of his mathematical studies and was on a trip, hitchhiking across the country, and got in a car with some lovely individuals who said "look we're driving straight through to Massachusetts and here we've got these amphetamines that are keeping us awake, why don't you stay awake with us?"</p>

<p>I got in the back seat of the car, we took these strange pills but alas the pills did not do what they were supposed to for the driver and at a certain point in Pennsylvania she drove off the road and went down a 200 foot embankment. I was in the back seat of that car and when I came to consciousness, a few moments after the car reached the bottom of the hill, I realized that I was probably paralyzed for life and was staring through the shattered windshield of a Chevrolet Nova up at a beautiful blue sky, bleeding from a skull fracture and serious set of internal injuries and the blood from the injuries to my head were seeping into the area around my eyes and my eyes were turning completely red and I was looking at the world through this strange blood-filter. I could see clearly, and all of a sudden as I looked through this shattered windshield I could see not the sky anymore, I could see this automobile and there was this sad young man in the car and there were ambulance crews trying to saw this car in half and I looked down and though "oh that's a terrible situation - what's going on? I hope that fellow is alright".</p>

<p>And I watched for a while and it was terribly noisy and I was feeling very relieved that I was far away from that mess and I stared at it for a while, and all of a sudden the view began to get a little dark and everything sort of rushed like the sound of a train and all of a sudden I realized that I was the person in the car and they had in fact managed to saw the roof off of the car and pull me to safely. I lost consciousness at that point and woke up in a recovery room in a hospital days later.</p>

<p>So what happened? What was going on in my brain during this event, because I remember it vividly, vividly and can recall precisely what I was looking at from down in the trees, down on what was happening to me, something I couldn't actually have possibly seen because I was in the vehicle. Was it just some "spiritual - whoa - intense experience" or does it reveal something fundamental about the organization of the brain? That's what we're going to explore tonight and we certainly have, as you already heard, the best person on planet Earth to help explore it with us. He's an author, scholar, doctor, clinician, professor and in many ways the pre-eminent storyteller of the brain. Please welcome Doctor, Professor, friend; Oliver Sacks.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm going to blog about Dr. Sacks' talk separately, but I wanted to highlight Hockenberry's introduction. It really was quite something.</p>
