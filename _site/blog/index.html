<h2><a href="/blog/london-weeknotes-1">London Week 1</a></h2>


<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/london-weeknotes-1" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">05 July 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p>It's been a very positive first full week in London.</p>

<p>Even though we've left New York, I'm going to continue working with Sloan-Kettering from London. I am really delighted about that. My working day in London overlaps with New York by about 4 hours, which is perfect - lots of time for us to collaborate, then lots of time for heads-down work.</p>

<p>Over the the coming year my focus will be on desinging experiences/agents (nimble little products) that use some of the wonderful knowledge available at MSKCC to help the hospital plan for the future, and make good day-to-day decisions.</p>

<p>This week I've just been getting set up. I've moved into a very nice co-working space in Hackney, and have been getting my desk and micro-office set up. The space overlooks the site of the 2012 Olympic Games, which is currently being redeveloped as a public park.</p>

<p>Next week, I'll continue to set up, and try to iron out some of the inevitable teething issues associated with working remotely are resolved. Then, it'll be down to work.</p>

<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/goodbye-for-now-new-york" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">11 June 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p>In a couple of hours we head to the airport, bound for Costa Rica, then Iceland - a gentle transition out of life in New York to something new. We are moving on after three amazing years.</p>

<p>The category of visa we have requires us to leave the US two years, before being eligible to stay for longer. I am not going to riff on the contradictions of the J visa right now, but it's fair to say that we wouldn't leave New York if we didn't have to. We are thriving here, and we both have a lot more to contribute to this great city.</p>

<p>We leave behind our places, routines, hobbies, and most importantly - our family, and our wonderful friends. We will miss them all. We know that it's more than possible to stay connected to them from afar, it'll just take a little more work. I am going to try to treat the distance as a fun challenge, and maybe as an opportunity to do some fun projects related to interaction at a distance.</p>

<p>Our destination, at least in the medium term, is London. I'm going to continue working on design projects related to healthcare and computation for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and I'm really delighted about this. I love my job. Cliona is looking for opportunities in biotech.</p>

<p>Honestly, I am not at the point where I'm excited about being in a new city, but I'll get there.</p>

<p>New York, friends and family - thank you so much for a great three years. We love you all.</p>

<h2><a href="/blog/watson-project-sloan-kettering">Watson Project at MSKCC</a></h2>


<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/watson-project-sloan-kettering" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">21 March 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p>It's been a busy month.</p>

<p>We've started to make plans for our exit from New York. We've narrowed down the list of European cities where we'd like to live, and have started to look into job opportunities.</p>

<p>As well as the exit planning, I've been working on a fascinating new project at <a href="http://www.mskcc.org/">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>.</p>

<p>The team I work with at Sloan-Kettering is working with IBM to train <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/index.shtml">Watson</a>, IBM's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17jeopardy-watson.html?pagewanted=all">machine learning and decision making system</a>, to diagnose different forms of cancer based on historical medical cases. Once the system has been trained and refined, Watson will be able to recommend appropriate courses of treatment for cancer patients. The project is groundbreaking, and was <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/03/the-robot-will-see-you-now/309216/">recently profiled in the Atlantic:</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Ari Caroline and his colleagues at Sloan-Kettering are leading Watson's training in cancer care. "You're going to need a tool like Watson," he says, given the rapidly increasing complexity of the field. (Photo: Kareem Black)</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/03/the-robot-will-see-you-now/309216/"><img src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/newsroom/img/2013/02/15/watson-meeting.jpg" class="photo" /></a></p>

<p>My role on the project is to work with the messier, less structured parts of anonymized medical records, to prepare clean data for the Watson machine learning pipeline. I've also had a little time to work on some of my own experiments involving machine learning and natural language processing.</p>

<p>It's a real privilege to be involved with the project, and to work with such audaciously intelligent people. I can't wait to get started in the morning, and my thoughts stay with the project long after I leave in the evening (in a good way). I have been spending a lot of my downtime thinking about the intersection of user experience design and different forms of machine learning. I hope to crystallize a few thoughts into blog articles soon.</p>

<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/everywhere-i-have-ever-lived" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">03 February 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p>We're leaving New York in June, departing for <em>we don't know where yet</em>. I can hardly believe that I'm moving again. By my count I've lived in 4 cities and approximately 12 houses/apartments in the past decade. This is the first time I've actually made a list of those places.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8325/8436957984_60f1b30394_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Kilbarrack Road, Dublin" class="photo"/>
My childhood home on Kilbarrack Road in Dublin. There's just too much to say about this great house. I drifted away slowly over the course of 2004/2005. My Dad sold the house few years later.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8052/8436956268_39398a9b97_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of East 53rd Street, Hyde Park, Chicago" class="photo"/>
In the summer of 2002 I spent 4 months living on East 53rd Street in Hyde Park, Chicago. I couldn't find a job, and was down to my last few dollars when I happened to bump into some other Irish people who worked at the Adler Planetarium. They recommended me for a job there, and I scraped by for another 2.5 months before heading back to Dublin. A very strange summer.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8221/8436957516_7c215675b7_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Shanowen Road, Dublin" class="photo"/>
For about three months of 2004 I lived in an apartment on Shanowen Road near DCU. My housemates were Michael Moriarty and Nicky Gallogly. I can't for the life of me remember how the three of us ended up living together, but it was nice.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8237/8435872435_c071b5b63f_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Glasnevin, Dublin" class="photo"/>
For a very brief period of 2004 or 2005, maybe a couple of months, I lived somewhere in Glasnevin, Dublin. I don't know the exact address and have incredibly patcy memories of this whole experience.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8369/8435883069_b8b0abe50d_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Dargle Road, Dublin" class="photo"/>
In 2005 I moved into a small house on Dargle Road in Drumcondra.  My housemates were Ciara Gogarty, Aoife McNamara, Eoin Norton, and for a very brief period, Padraig Kilbride. The house was decrepit, the landlord was a spiv, and the dishes were never done, but we had fun there. The incident with the rat wasn't much fun.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8435872221_606ab2c1ca_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Booterstown Park, Dublin" class="photo"/>
In 2006 I moved to a rather grand house on Booterstown Park; my first foray onto the South Side of Dublin. My housemates were Karl Podesta, Louise Connolly, and Johnny Callaghan. Even though this was a very quiet street in a very quiet area, I really enjoyed living here. My room was huge, the garden was great, the kitchen was great, and everybody did their bit to keep the house in working order. It was a really pleasant experience all round. Not cheap though.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8224/8435873423_1451725dee_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Titania Street, Belfast" class="photo"/>
In 2007 I quit my wretched job in management consulting and moved to Belfast to work at Front (now part of Monotype). I lived in a little house on Titania Street off the Cregagh Road, first in the attic room, then in a nicer front-facing room. My constantly rotating cast of housemates included Emma, Aasa, Greg, and Mario. They were all very nice.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8463/8435871471_3cb41c70e0_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Rossmore Avenue, Belfast" class="photo"/>
In February of 2009 the constantly changing cast of characters at Titania Street, and a desire to be closer to both work and a swimming pool, prompted me to relocate across the city to Rossmore Avenue. My new housemates were Cassie, Breda, Chris, Johann, and for a short time, Emma.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8075/8436971692_09286e4923_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Rossmore Avenue, Belfast" class="photo"/>
I spent weekdays in Belfast, but came back to Dublin on weekends to stay with Cliona. I was frequently to be found at her place on Parnell Street. Cliona's flatmates, Beatriz and then Kate, tolerated me beyond the call of duty and reason.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8502/8435871615_d9a2009481_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of North Great George's Street, Dublin" class="photo"/>
In September of 2009 I managed to persuade the folks at Front to let me work from Dublin 2 days a week. Me and Cliona rented a really nice basement/garden apartment on North Great George's Street in Dublin. This is probably the most fabulous place I will ever live. We had a spare bedroom and a huge garden. We are able to have parties without bothering a soul. We spent a happy year here in the run up to our wedding.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8080/8436957678_23eb4605cc_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Sagimor Gardens, Belfast" class="photo"/>
In 2009/2010 I was spending 3 nights a week in Belfast, and 4 nights a week in Dublin, so to cut down on costs I moved out of Rossmore Avenue in Belfast and rented a tiny room in a house in East Belfast. The owner of the house, Sarah, was very nice. She was saving up so that she could quit her job and go sailing for a year. I don't know if she ever went.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8435873717_e92f8a68e3_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Ocean Avenue, Brooklyn" class="photo"/>
In August 2010 I arrived in New York to start at NYU. I spent a couple of weeks staying with Courtney Kelly, but soon found a great apartment on Ocean Avenue in Prospect Leffert Gardens. Cliona arrived in New York a couple of months later, and we are still living on Ocean Avenue 2.5 years later. This really feels like home. I hope, probably in vain, that the next place we live is as good to us as this place has been.</p>

<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/tom-sorell-on-surveillance" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">02 February 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p>In the latest episode of the excellent <a href="http://philosophybites.com/2013/01/tom-sorell-on-surveillance.html">Philosophy Bites</a> podcast, philosopher Tom Sorell eloquently describes why surveillance-free spaces are important. Sorell is taking part in the <a href="http://www.surveille.eu/">Surveille project</a> that is examining the usage and ethics of surveillance in Europe.</p>

<blockquote><p>If one has to answer the question "what in general makes privacy valuable?" it may be that you need privacy in order to be an autonomous person.</p>

<p>Even to be you, you need a space of autonomous reflection, otherwise you might become the mouthpiece for the people around you. If you're never able to have this space that's afforded by the private mind, you just become a mouthpiece for the official view, or the views of your parents, or the views of your friendship group. You need a space in which you're able to put your own stamp on your beliefs, and that means coming up with reasons for them from your own point of view.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't agree with everything Sorell says (I <em>do</em> believe that the use of surveillance necessarily involves a power relationship), but what he has to say is thought-provoking. Surveillance is an important issue to consider, especially given the ubiquity of social software, connected cameras, and rapidly shifting norms around what constitutes public and private space. It's good to see the EU funding work like this.</p>

<div class="content"><p><a href="http://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> is a wonderful creative programming class taught at ITP by <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/">Dan Shiffman</a>. In The Nature of Code, students learn how to programme software applications that mimic nature in some way, covering topics like gravity, wind, flocking, learning and evolution. For my own final project I made <a href="https://vimeo.com/41397044">a little simulation</a> where creatures are born, flock, find food, react to danger, age and die.</p>

<p>The class was a real revelation for me. I wasn't good at maths or physics in school, and only really started to grasp concepts like trigonometry, vectors and forces in Dan's class. I really wish that a class like this (and more creative methods of teaching) had been available when I was much younger.</p>

<p>Dan has just <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0985930802/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0985930802&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=natureofcode-20">released a book</a> that covers, and expands upon, the content of the class. There's a freely available <a href="https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples">library of code</a> and Dan is <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/464686">recording a series of (highly entertaining) videos</a> to help students along.</p>

<p>I can't recommend The Nature of Code highly enough. Enjoy the content from the class, and help it finds its way to people teaching maths, physics, biology, or computing to young people.</p>

<h2><a href="/blog/uncompensated-design-challenges">Uncompensated Design Challenges</a></h2>


<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/uncompensated-design-challenges" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">24 January 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p>New York City has issued a design challenge called <a href="http://www.reinventpayphones.splashthat.com/">Reinvent Payphones</a> and has asked designers to think of new uses for the city's payphone infrastructure. I went along to the information session last night and was pretty disheartened. I just don't think that the approach being taken by the city will result in a good outcome for the city, or the designers who take part.</p>

<p>The start of a successful design project is a clear statement of need, a description of a context and some sense of what is expected - constraints. With Reinvent Payphones there is no clear statement of why the City needs or wants to reinvent payones other than the expiration of the current commercial payphone contracts.</p>

<p>The City can't offer any useful data about payphone usage, the role that the phones play in the life of the city, or the changing context.</p>

<p>They give <a href="http://www.reinventpayphones.splashthat.com/#nyc_nav">a list of things that are important</a>, but don't say which things are more important than others.</p>

<p>If the City was really invested in the outcome of the challenge then more care and attention should have been put into writing the brief; describing the context, offering useful data, stating a problem, setting clear goals - and then being flexible about the form of the solution (maybe a reinvented payphone isn't a reinvented payphone).</p>

<p>Next, there are the rules. Even though designers are encouraged to design and build prototypes, they will receive no compensation for their time or materials. They automatically give the city a free, perptetual license to use their work. A commercial procurement process for the development of a new payphone system will be run "completely separately". But, the City acknowledges that designers' ideas might be incorporated into that process. How is this fair?</p>

<p>Between the very poorly-stated brief and the harsh terms, Reinvent Payphones seems to boil down to the City using members of the design community to flesh out the requirements of a commerical contract, in return for some praise and publicity.</p>

<p>To me, this falls into the category of uncompensated design, or spec work, and it's disheartening to see a City like New York trawling for spec work. Here are just a few of my reasons why challenges like this are bad:</p>

<ol>
<li>Uncompensated design challenges are exploitative. When a company or organization with the wherewithal to offer compensation asks a designer to solve a problem and then give the solution to them for free, that is exploitative. Just because the organization arranges for the person to be praised in public for being such a good sport is irrelevant. Publicity is gratifying but it doesn't put food on the table.</li>
<li>Uncompensated design challenges reward the wrong thing. Is the design that gains the widest publicity the best design? Of course not. It's just the one optimized for maximum public acceptance.</li>
<li>Uncompensated design challenges are elitist. Uncompensated design challenges exclude people who have the most to gain from good design from the design process. The underserved and disadvantaged can't gamble their time on the promise of good vibes, or the possibility of a paying job down the road.</li>
</ol>


<p>If we take these few problems and run them over time, what do we get? We get a lot of designers doing work but only some living with dignity. We get a class of "successful" designers who live apart from the people who really need the products of good design. We get a design culture where people who shape reputations hold far more power than the people we design for. We optimise for designs that are "right" because they find favour. We separate designers from the context (and the "client") and expect them to just riff on ideas, as though that's the same thing as design.</p>

<p>I am not alone. Universities and professional associations urge caution around design challenges and spec work:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.design.cmu.edu/files/school_of_design_position_on_solicitations_for_competitions.pdf">The School of Design at Carnegie Mellon University</a>:  We discourage proposals for competitions because they are usually a solicitation of design concepts to be produced on a speculative basis by the professionals you are considering. We do not participate in, or promote projects that essentially ask students to design on 'spec'.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aiga.org/position-spec-work/">AIGA</a> believes that professional designers should be compensated fairly for their work and should negotiate the ownership or use rights of their intellectual and creative property through an engagement with clients. To that end, AIGA strongly encourages designers to enter into client projects with full engagement to show the value of their creative endeavor, and to be aware of all potential risks before entering into speculative work.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know that New York City can do better than this. I'd love to hear your thoughts about design challenges. Maybe you can think of ways to encourage participation without exploitation?</p>

<h2><a href="/blog/upstream-color">Upstream Color</a></h2>


<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/upstream-color" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">20 January 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8517/8400307938_80ea7a7188_b_d.jpg" alt="a still photo from Upstream Color. A man and a woman lie together, fully dressed in an empty bath tub" / class="photo">
I'm excited to see Shane Carruth's new film, <a href="http://www.shanecarruth.com/film/upstreamcolor">Upstream Color</a>. Carruth is the writer and director of one of my favourite films, <a href="http://www.shanecarruth/film/primer">Primer</a>. Made on a shoestring budget and released in 2004, Primer updates a well-worn mainstay of science fiction storytelling, the "time-machines are probably a bad idea" tale. The film's major innovation was to show, in ambitious detail, the practical and emotional burdens of time travel.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/53890508?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="700" height="394" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>As life for the two protagonists divides into a tangle of recursive, competing timelines we're asked to consider how complicated things would get if more people had access to the time machine. Like all time-machine stories, Primer is a moral fable about the limits of human imagination and the hazard of acting purely in self interest. It's an energetic, rich, and very rewarding film.</p>

<p>My hope is that Upstream Color comes close to being as entertaining as Primer. The press notes and trailer for the film are compelling in their vagueness:</p>

<blockquote><p>A man and woman are drawn together, entangled in the lifecycle of an ageless organism. Identity becomes an illusion as they struggle to assemble the loose fragments of wrecked lives.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upstream Color will be shown at the <a href="http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13010/upstream_color">Sundance Film Festival</a> next week before going on limited/guerrilla release in April.</p>

<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/film-an-odyssey" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">08 January 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><iframe width="700" height="525" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/usQIoKoJSFM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>I am <em>really</em> enjoying Mark Cousins' series <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2044056/"><em>The Story of Film: An Odyssey</em></a> which is now available to stream on <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Story_of_Film_An_Odyssey/70261400?locale=en-US">Netflix</a>. It is a beautifully made documentary broken into 15, one hour-long episodes. <em>The Story of Film</em> traces the history of film from its birth through to the current day.</p>

<p>Unlike a lot of film historians, Cousins really goes out of his way to show examples of films from all over the world, like Yevgeni Bauer's <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0005916/">After Death</a></em> (<em>Posle Smerti</em>) from Russia, made in 1915 (above).</p>

<p>What really comes across is the rapid change that cinema underwent in the decades after its invention. By the time film was a couple of decades old it had been transformed from a curiosity into an art form. Fascination with the technology of filmmaking had been superseded by a fascination with new forms of storytelling enabled by technology.</p>

<p>By the 1920s filmmakers had formulated, refined and then deliberately subverted successive forms of film-making. The grammar of film was constantly being re-written and the result was innumerable, fascinating, deeply different films.</p>

<p>By comparison, today's cinema - and indeed all media - look timid and conformist. The web is about as old as cinema was during its heady days of experimentation and is becoming more cynical and homogenous each year. If the history of cinema tells us anything it's that we shouldn't be afraid to write a new rule book, or indeed to burn that rule book when things become too familiar.</p>

<p><em>The Story of Film: An Odyssey</em> is inspiring. It has put fire in my belly. I really recommend it.</p>
