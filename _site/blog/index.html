<div class="content"><p>Busy week. Desire to turn off computer for the evening. All quickies.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3815/9384652196_d6cab8217c_o.jpg" class="photo" alt="Duck Pal"></p>

<h3>Quickies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Last weekend we took a trip to the British Museum. It's astounding. The Rosetta Stone is jawdropping. The number of tourists in the British Museum jostling to get a terrible, flash-lit photograph of the Rosetta Stone is jawdropping, in a very different way. The British Museum is wall to wall loot, and tourists clambering over and photographing said loot in a frenzy.</li>
<li>We had a very tasty breakfast at Towpath Cafe, then visited Columbia Road Flower Market, and Hackney City Farm (see Duck, above). Gorgeous, gorgeous.</li>
<li>Cliona has been interviewing for jobs, and has made very good progress - news soon.</li>
<li>We've been tip-toeing our way through the latest episodes of Breaking Bad. It's so, so, so good. Probably the most compelling TV show I've ever watched.</li>
<li>I am making progress with yoga. I am still the sweaty beginner in the class, but I can feel myself getting stronger. Less painful vibration as I hold simple poses. Result.</li>
<li>A so-so week at work. Nobody said this was going to be easy.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="/blog/london-weeknotes-4">London Week 4</a></h2>


<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/london-weeknotes-4" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">26 July 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p>This week has been pretty good.</p>

<p>On Saturday/Sunday I completed the Dunwich Dynamo; an overnight bike ride from London to Suffolk. I covered just over 175Km in about 7 hours 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The first 75Km out of London were refreshing - some stopping and starting, roundabouts, and a few gentle rises to wake up the legs. I was glad to reach the rest stop just after midnight. I took on water and had some very decent food, provided by volunteers.</p>

<p>With the sun completely gone, but with a bright moon to give a bit of a glow to the roads, I got into a group of cyclists from 75Km to 130km and made good time in their train. It is somewhat surreal to barrel along on quiet country roads in the dead of night, following a trail of blinking red lights that stretches off into the gloom. Just the sound of wheels on the road, and the click-click of my freewheel.</p>

<p>I got a little lost between 130Km and 150Km. Thankfully two other cyclists also took the wrong turn, and one of them knew how to get back to the main route. We got back in contact, and settled into the last 20-30Km. A slog. I was tired, and my legs were starting to tighten.</p>

<p>When I made it to Dunwich beach just after 5am I had a couple of cups of tea, a bar of chocolate, a protein drink. Some people got in for a swim.  I just had a nice sit down. The bus back to London left just after 9am. At home, I ate lunch, had a shower, and proceeded to pass out for several hours.</p>

<p>The Dynamo was definitely the highlight of the week, and I'll do it again next year.</p>

<p>In other news, my work is challenging at the moment - in good ways and bad. Cliona is searching and interviewing for jobs. She is making great progress.</p>

<p>The first full month in London has flown by.</p>

<h3>Quickies</h3>

<ul>
<li>I am falling behind in the linear algebra class, and thinking of shelving it for now. I've already learned a lot, and I can come back to it on my own time, or the next time the online class is run.</li>
<li>I finished 1Q84. It's definitely the least coherent and most conventional Murakami book that I've read. Whole sections feel repititious. There's a sort of sappy misogyny about the plot. The resolution feels like an unconvincing magic trick. It's his worst book to date in my opinion.</li>
<li>What should I read next?</li>
<li>I've started taking yoga classes, they are very challenging, but I think I am making progress.</li>
</ul>

<div class="content"><p>I spent last weekend in Ireland; at a wedding in Longford on the Saturday, and in Dublin on the Sunday. The weather in Ireland is roasting. The country really shines in the sun. The landscape sparkles, people are happy and friendly, and there's a sense of optimism about the place that's sometimes absent in the greyer months. It was a real pleasure to see Ireland at its best.</p>

<p>While I was in Dublin, I got to meet Mr. Jack Holland, newly arrived son of Therese Veale and Derek Holland. He is a dote of the highest order, well-mannered to boot, and his parents were a sight for sore eyes.</p>

<p>I managed to get a spot on a return bus for the <a href="http://southwarkcyclists.org.uk/news/dunwich-dynamo-xxi-2013-faqs-essentials">Dunwich Dynamo</a>, an overnight ride from London to Dunwich, Suffolk. It's 120 miles, or about 200Km. I haven't done a cycle of that length in quite a while, but I'm told it's pretty flat.</p>

<p>I've been using the same cycling gear since about 2008, and having left a lot of it in the US, or disposed of it altogether, it was time to get new stuff. I bought myself a new jersey, shorts, helmet, shoes - and some other bits and pieces. Thanks to Alex at Swift Cycles in London for helping me choose and fit the gear properly.</p>

<p>Work is going pretty well. Design and development of two products is proceeding nicely.</p>

<h3>Quickies</h3>

<ul>
<li>My linear algebra practice has being getting scant attention. I am sorry linear algebra gods.</li>
<li>I am 90% of the way through 1Q84. I don't get a sense that it'll end satisfactorily. I can't say it's been among my favourite Murakami books; it needs a damn good editing.</li>

<div class="content"><p>Not too much to report this week. I've been continuing to get set up in London, and have been working on some early plans for two new projects.</p>

<p>Tonight I'm off to Dublin for a flying visit - I'll be in Longford at a wedding tomorrow, then back in Dublin for a few hours on Sunday.</p>

<h3>Quickies</h3>

<ul>
<li>I bought a Windows laptop to use as my work computer. It's ugly.</li>
<li>I finally bought a scanner that can scan negatives, slides/positives.</li>
<li>I have not done any of my linear algebra coursework this week.</li>

<div class="content"><p>It's been a very positive first full week in London.</p>

<p>Even though we've left New York, I'm going to continue working with Sloan-Kettering from London. I am really delighted about that. My working day in London overlaps with New York by about 4 hours, which is perfect - lots of time for us to collaborate, then lots of time for heads-down work.</p>

<p>Over the the coming year my focus will be on designing experiences/agents (nimble little products) that use some of the wonderful knowledge available at MSKCC to help the hospital plan for the future, and make good day-to-day decisions.</p>

<p>This week I've just been getting set up. I've moved into a very nice co-working space in Hackney, and have been getting my desk and micro-office set up. The space overlooks the site of the 2012 Olympic Games, which is currently being redeveloped as a public park.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3766/9212353117_ecd0ce2357_o.jpg" width="612" height="612" alt="Olympic Village Recalibration" class="photo"></p>

<p>Next week, I'll finish getting set up. Then, it'll be down to some real work.</p>

<h3>Quickies</h3>

<ul>
<li>I invested in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>, a fabulous text editor.</li>
<li>I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005QVZ79C/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">this monitor</a> for my desk.</li>
<li>I have started using <a href="http://instagram.com/paulmayorg/">Instagram</a>, despite my queasiness about their terms and conditions. My real photos will still be uploaded to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/">Flickr</a>.</li>
<li>I have still not scanned any of the photos I took in May or June.</li>
<li>I am taking <a href="https://class.coursera.org/matrix-001/">this class</a> on linear algebra. So far, it's not much fun.</li>
<li>I am 60% of the way through 1Q84.</li>

<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/goodbye-for-now-new-york" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">11 June 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p>In a couple of hours we head to the airport, bound for Costa Rica, then Iceland - a gentle transition out of life in New York to something new. We are moving on after three amazing years.</p>

<p>The category of visa we have requires us to leave the US two years, before being eligible to stay for longer. I am not going to riff on the contradictions of the J visa right now, but it's fair to say that we wouldn't leave New York if we didn't have to. We are thriving here, and we both have a lot more to contribute to this great city.</p>

<p>We leave behind our places, routines, hobbies, and most importantly - our family, and our wonderful friends. We will miss them all. We know that it's more than possible to stay connected to them from afar, it'll just take a little more work. I am going to try to treat the distance as a fun challenge, and maybe as an opportunity to do some fun projects related to interaction at a distance.</p>

<p>Our destination, at least in the medium term, is London. I'm going to continue working on design projects related to healthcare and computation for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and I'm really delighted about this. I love my job. Cliona is looking for opportunities in biotech.</p>

<p>Honestly, I am not at the point where I'm excited about being in a new city, but I'll get there.</p>

<p>New York, friends and family - thank you so much for a great three years. We love you all.</p>

<h2><a href="/blog/watson-project-sloan-kettering">Watson Project at MSKCC</a></h2>


<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/watson-project-sloan-kettering" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">21 March 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p>It's been a busy month.</p>

<p>We've started to make plans for our exit from New York. We've narrowed down the list of European cities where we'd like to live, and have started to look into job opportunities.</p>

<p>As well as the exit planning, I've been working on a fascinating new project at <a href="http://www.mskcc.org/">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>.</p>

<p>The team I work with at Sloan-Kettering is working with IBM to train <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/index.shtml">Watson</a>, IBM's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17jeopardy-watson.html?pagewanted=all">machine learning and decision making system</a>, to diagnose different forms of cancer based on historical medical cases. Once the system has been trained and refined, Watson will be able to recommend appropriate courses of treatment for cancer patients. The project is groundbreaking, and was <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/03/the-robot-will-see-you-now/309216/">recently profiled in the Atlantic:</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Ari Caroline and his colleagues at Sloan-Kettering are leading Watson's training in cancer care. "You're going to need a tool like Watson," he says, given the rapidly increasing complexity of the field. (Photo: Kareem Black)</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/03/the-robot-will-see-you-now/309216/"><img src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/newsroom/img/2013/02/15/watson-meeting.jpg" class="photo" /></a></p>

<p>My role on the project is to work with the messier, less structured parts of anonymized medical records, to prepare clean data for the Watson machine learning pipeline. I've also had a little time to work on some of my own experiments involving machine learning and natural language processing.</p>

<p>It's a real privilege to be involved with the project, and to work with such audaciously intelligent people. I can't wait to get started in the morning, and my thoughts stay with the project long after I leave in the evening (in a good way). I have been spending a lot of my downtime thinking about the intersection of user experience design and different forms of machine learning. I hope to crystallize a few thoughts into blog articles soon.</p>

<div class="content"><p>We're leaving New York in June, departing for <em>we don't know where yet</em>. I can hardly believe that I'm moving again. By my count I've lived in 4 cities and approximately 12 houses/apartments in the past decade. This is the first time I've actually made a list of those places.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8325/8436957984_60f1b30394_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Kilbarrack Road, Dublin" class="photo"/>
My childhood home on Kilbarrack Road in Dublin. There's just too much to say about this great house. I drifted away slowly over the course of 2004/2005. My Dad sold the house few years later.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8052/8436956268_39398a9b97_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of East 53rd Street, Hyde Park, Chicago" class="photo"/>
In the summer of 2002 I spent 4 months living on East 53rd Street in Hyde Park, Chicago. I couldn't find a job, and was down to my last few dollars when I happened to bump into some other Irish people who worked at the Adler Planetarium. They recommended me for a job there, and I scraped by for another 2.5 months before heading back to Dublin. A very strange summer.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8221/8436957516_7c215675b7_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Shanowen Road, Dublin" class="photo"/>
For about three months of 2004 I lived in an apartment on Shanowen Road near DCU. My housemates were Michael Moriarty and Nicky Gallogly. I can't for the life of me remember how the three of us ended up living together, but it was nice.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8237/8435872435_c071b5b63f_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Glasnevin, Dublin" class="photo"/>
For a very brief period of 2004 or 2005, maybe a couple of months, I lived somewhere in Glasnevin, Dublin. I don't know the exact address and have incredibly patcy memories of this whole experience.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8369/8435883069_b8b0abe50d_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Dargle Road, Dublin" class="photo"/>
In 2005 I moved into a small house on Dargle Road in Drumcondra.  My housemates were Ciara Gogarty, Aoife McNamara, Eoin Norton, and for a very brief period, Padraig Kilbride. The house was decrepit, the landlord was a spiv, and the dishes were never done, but we had fun there. The incident with the rat wasn't much fun.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8435872221_606ab2c1ca_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Booterstown Park, Dublin" class="photo"/>
In 2006 I moved to a rather grand house on Booterstown Park; my first foray onto the South Side of Dublin. My housemates were Karl Podesta, Louise Connolly, and Johnny Callaghan. Even though this was a very quiet street in a very quiet area, I really enjoyed living here. My room was huge, the garden was great, the kitchen was great, and everybody did their bit to keep the house in working order. It was a really pleasant experience all round. Not cheap though.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8224/8435873423_1451725dee_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Titania Street, Belfast" class="photo"/>
In 2007 I quit my wretched job in management consulting and moved to Belfast to work at Front (now part of Monotype). I lived in a little house on Titania Street off the Cregagh Road, first in the attic room, then in a nicer front-facing room. My constantly rotating cast of housemates included Emma, Aasa, Greg, and Mario. They were all very nice.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8463/8435871471_3cb41c70e0_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Rossmore Avenue, Belfast" class="photo"/>
In February of 2009 the constantly changing cast of characters at Titania Street, and a desire to be closer to both work and a swimming pool, prompted me to relocate across the city to Rossmore Avenue. My new housemates were Cassie, Breda, Chris, Johann, and for a short time, Emma.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8075/8436971692_09286e4923_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Rossmore Avenue, Belfast" class="photo"/>
I spent weekdays in Belfast, but came back to Dublin on weekends to stay with Cliona. I was frequently to be found at her place on Parnell Street. Cliona's flatmates, Beatriz and then Kate, tolerated me beyond the call of duty and reason.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8502/8435871615_d9a2009481_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of North Great George's Street, Dublin" class="photo"/>
In September of 2009 I managed to persuade the folks at Front to let me work from Dublin 2 days a week. Me and Cliona rented a really nice basement/garden apartment on North Great George's Street in Dublin. This is probably the most fabulous place I will ever live. We had a spare bedroom and a huge garden. We are able to have parties without bothering a soul. We spent a happy year here in the run up to our wedding.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8080/8436957678_23eb4605cc_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Sagimor Gardens, Belfast" class="photo"/>
In 2009/2010 I was spending 3 nights a week in Belfast, and 4 nights a week in Dublin, so to cut down on costs I moved out of Rossmore Avenue in Belfast and rented a tiny room in a house in East Belfast. The owner of the house, Sarah, was very nice. She was saving up so that she could quit her job and go sailing for a year. I don't know if she ever went.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8435873717_e92f8a68e3_b_d.jpg" alt="Satellite photo of Ocean Avenue, Brooklyn" class="photo"/>
In August 2010 I arrived in New York to start at NYU. I spent a couple of weeks staying with Courtney Kelly, but soon found a great apartment on Ocean Avenue in Prospect Leffert Gardens. Cliona arrived in New York a couple of months later, and we are still living on Ocean Avenue 2.5 years later. This really feels like home. I hope, probably in vain, that the next place we live is as good to us as this place has been.</p>

<h2><a href="/blog/tom-sorell-on-surveillance">Tom Sorell on Surveillance</a></h2>


<div class="postmeta"><p class="date"><a href="http://www.paulmay.org/blog/tom-sorell-on-surveillance" class="permalink" title="Permalink to this article">02 February 2013</a></p></div>


<div class="content"><p>In the latest episode of the excellent <a href="http://philosophybites.com/2013/01/tom-sorell-on-surveillance.html">Philosophy Bites</a> podcast, philosopher Tom Sorell eloquently describes why surveillance-free spaces are important. Sorell is taking part in the <a href="http://www.surveille.eu/">Surveille project</a> that is examining the usage and ethics of surveillance in Europe.</p>

<blockquote><p>If one has to answer the question "what in general makes privacy valuable?" it may be that you need privacy in order to be an autonomous person.</p>

<p>Even to be you, you need a space of autonomous reflection, otherwise you might become the mouthpiece for the people around you. If you're never able to have this space that's afforded by the private mind, you just become a mouthpiece for the official view, or the views of your parents, or the views of your friendship group. You need a space in which you're able to put your own stamp on your beliefs, and that means coming up with reasons for them from your own point of view.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't agree with everything Sorell says (I <em>do</em> believe that the use of surveillance necessarily involves a power relationship), but what he has to say is thought-provoking. Surveillance is an important issue to consider, especially given the ubiquity of social software, connected cameras, and rapidly shifting norms around what constitutes public and private space. It's good to see the EU funding work like this.</p>
