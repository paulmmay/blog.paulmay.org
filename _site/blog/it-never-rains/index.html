		<p>Yay! I have a job! I met some really cool Irish people on the bus the other night, and they all worked at the Adler Planetarium. They said I should go down there to see if they were hiring any more people, so I did. I talked to a woman named Peggy, who said that while they weren't planning on hiring any more summer help, they'd make an exception because the other Irish lads were so nice! So, I start training on Friday for 4 days, and then I'm all set.</p>

<p>The day after I talked to the people at the Planetarium I got a call from the Field Museum who want to interview me on Monday. It's a bit strange to have gone a month without getting a job, and then to have two come along at once. I'm definitely going to take the Planetarium job, and I might even go to the Field Museum interview...we'll see.</p>

<p>So, it's all good...the summer is saved. God bless America!</p>
