<p>I've been in Chicago for two weeks now. I moved into my apartment a few days ago, and I'm starting to settle in. Money is tight....very tight. I haven't found a job yet, so I spend most days wandering around with CVs or poring over the help wanted sections of the local papers. I was offered a really good web design job, but I would have needed a car to get to it...so that one went out the window.</p>

<p>So, the weather is fine here. We spent a week in South Carolina doing some kayaking, fishing, drinking and general lazing about. It was a great trip, and the 1000 mile drive each way was a really fun road trip. The South has a weird vibe to it, which I can't really put my finger on. The place is teeming with life, but it's really really hot. Everything is either flourishing in the heat, or being consumed by it...it's very strange.</p>

<p>The house where we stayed was on a barrier island off the coast of South Carolina. It was a half nature reserve, half resort town. All the houses blended perfectly into the trees and foliage, so you really couldn't tell that the island was inhabited. The house itself was amazing, and had it's own dock which extended out into one of the island's inlets. We fished and kayaked off the dock, barbecued and drank in the evenings, fell asleep drunk under the stars, and got bitten by some of the local mosquitos. It was a great trip...but I've probably mentioned that already.</p>

<p>So now it's back to reality. I really have to find a job, and stories of the streets being paved with gold have definitely been exaggerated :)</p>

<p>This is Paul in Chicago, signing off.</p>
