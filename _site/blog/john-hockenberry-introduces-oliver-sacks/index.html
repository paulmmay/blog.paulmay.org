		<p>I had the pleasure of seeing <a href="http://www.oliversacks.com/">Dr. Oliver Sacks</a> in conversation with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hockenberry">John Hockenberry</a> at the Cooper Union last night. Sacks was speaking about his latest book <em>Hallucinations</em> as part of the <a href="http://worldsciencefestival.com/webcasts/sacks?/events/sacks">World Science Festival</a>. It was a really great event, not least because of John Hockenberry's stunning introduction:</p>

<blockquote><p>Tonight we're going to explore this notion of hallucinations. There's a really young crowd here. I hasten to say don't try this at home but I suspect many of you have. Oh well. Be that as it may. Let me tell you a little hallucination story here in this hall, where we might even get a glimpse of <a href="http://www.nps.gov/liho/historyculture/summary.htm">Abraham Lincoln</a> if we're lucky. All of New York this week is something of a hallucination. My neighborhood looks like Gaza. We're experiencing a sense of perceptual distortion from our encounters with the natural world this week.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about a young fellow who studied mathematics at the University of Chicago a couple of decades ago who had a predisposition for psilocybin mushrooms in the course of his mathematical studies and was on a trip, hitchhiking across the country, and got in a car with some lovely individuals who said "look we're driving straight through to Massachusetts and here we've got these amphetamines that are keeping us awake, why don't you stay awake with us?"</p>

<p>I got in the back seat of the car, we took these strange pills but alas the pills did not do what they were supposed to for the driver and at a certain point in Pennsylvania she drove off the road and went down a 200 foot embankment. I was in the back seat of that car and when I came to consciousness, a few moments after the car reached the bottom of the hill, I realized that I was probably paralyzed for life and was staring through the shattered windshield of a Chevrolet Nova up at a beautiful blue sky, bleeding from a skull fracture and serious set of internal injuries and the blood from the injuries to my head were seeping into the area around my eyes and my eyes were turning completely red and I was looking at the world through this strange blood-filter. I could see clearly, and all of a sudden as I looked through this shattered windshield I could see not the sky anymore, I could see this automobile and there was this sad young man in the car and there were ambulance crews trying to saw this car in half and I looked down and though "oh that's a terrible situation - what's going on? I hope that fellow is alright".</p>

<p>And I watched for a while and it was terribly noisy and I was feeling very relieved that I was far away from that mess and I stared at it for a while, and all of a sudden the view began to get a little dark and everything sort of rushed like the sound of a train and all of a sudden I realized that I was the person in the car and they had in fact managed to saw the roof off of the car and pull me to safely. I lost consciousness at that point and woke up in a recovery room in a hospital days later.</p>

<p>So what happened? What was going on in my brain during this event, because I remember it vividly, vividly and can recall precisely what I was looking at from down in the trees, down on what was happening to me, something I couldn't actually have possibly seen because I was in the vehicle. Was it just some "spiritual - whoa - intense experience" or does it reveal something fundamental about the organization of the brain? That's what we're going to explore tonight and we certainly have, as you already heard, the best person on planet Earth to help explore it with us. He's an author, scholar, doctor, clinician, professor and in many ways the pre-eminent storyteller of the brain. Please welcome Doctor, Professor, friend; Oliver Sacks.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm going to blog about Dr. Sacks' talk separately, but I wanted to highlight Hockenberry's introduction. It really was quite something.</p>
