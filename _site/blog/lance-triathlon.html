		<p>To call today’s New York Times article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/sports/cycling/lance-armstrong-draws-mixed-reception-from-triathlon-community.html">Armstrong Finds a Mixed Reception in Triathlon</a> utterly disingenuous would be putting it mildly.</p>

<p>Lance Armstrong has been completely banned from the internationally governed (i.e. non-corporate) forms of triathlon because <a href="http://cyclinginvestigation.usada.org/">he used drugs to cheat in cycling</a>. He has taken part in a small number of triathlons that were so desperate for publicity they opted out of the sport’s rulebook and insurance coverage to allow him to race.</p>

<p>Drawing an equivalence between his official, global ban and his invitation to take part in rogue races is wrong. Saying that this represents “mixed feelings” is shabby.</p>

<p>If a golfer was caught taking drugs and banned from playing in any tournament that followed the official rules of golf, but was then invited to play big drive, trick shot and crazy golf tournaments, you would call that <em>being banned from golf</em>.</p>

<p>Just because it’s Lance doesn’t mean it’s complicated.</p>
