<p>Hey there. Things have been settling into a nice routine here in Oxford.</p>

<p>I have moved into, then out of a local co-working space - and I'm now working out of a little home office. The co-working space was nice, but I've been traveling to New York every 4-5 weeks, and it was hard to justify the cost. Working at home has <a href="/blog/how-to-not-go-insane-while-working-from-home/">some familiar challenges</a>, but I've done everything I can to make sure that the home office feels comfortable and somewhat separate.</p>

<p>I bought a bike, and joined a local cycling club. I haven't really put many miles into my legs yet - but I am looking forward to getting into the rhythm of weekend spins out in the countryside.</p>

<p>Cliona is doing well; she bought a car, which has made her commute to work much more manageable. This week she's in Donegal visiting some colleagues. Next week I'm in New York, then she's in California. We are both working very hard, and traveling a bit - but we'll get a break towards the end of the year and Christmas.</p>

<p>We have been thinking about getting a dog for quite a while. It was never really practical in New York, because we knew that our time there was likely to be brief. Now that we're starting to feel at home in Oxford, and have some more space, we've started to look around for an animal-pal. We visited Oxford Animal Sanctuary, and met three lovely dogs. Two of them were great, but too big for us, and one was small, but seemed to be a little on the grumpy side. Anyway, now that we've dipped our toes in the water, we're going to think about the type and size of dog that we can handle, and in the New Year go out and see if we can find that dog. We know that he or she is out there.</p>

<p>I have not been taking many photos, mostly because I can't find a good lab in Oxford. Nowhere, and I mean nowhere that I can find will process black and white. Most places are reluctant to take film at all. Given that I am only shooting on film these days, that's putting a cramp on things. Anyway, I might need to shoot film, then take day trips to London to get rolls processed. It's not ideal. Anyway, we'll see what happens - but I would like to get back to the camera as soon as possible.</p>

<p>So, that's what's happening right now.</p>
