		<p class="intro">London lived up to the hype; it was a great race with over 9000 people competing over the two days of the race - officially the  largest race in the world. Like Dublin, the weather in London has been dreadful this summer - except for this weekend when temperatures hit 30 degrees during the race. Luckily I was in the 7am wave, so I was out of the heat before it got too grim.</p>

My race went pretty well - I was really happy with my time of 2.31.33, but the swim was a bit ruined when some fool pulled my goggles off.  I swam 1200m in horrible water with no goggles and was pretty pissed off until well into the cycle (angry cycling). The cycle itself was fine - closed roads all the way through central London with some very fast sections through tunnels along the Thames. The turn on the bike was just at Big Ben, opposite the London Eye and the scenery was a real bonus (even though I didn't pay too much attention to be honest). The run was warm and pretty uneventful, just a two-lap grind around Victoria dock - then into the Excel centre to cross the finish line with cameras flashing and a great atmosphere all round. All the Piranhas did really well, I'm sure they'll be posting their own reports on the <a href="http://www.piranhatri.com" target="_parent">Piranha Site</a>. Special thanks to Cliona for the support and for helping me lug my bag and bike around London for the weekend.</p>

<p>In 5 hours I'm moving to Belfast - how did that happen? :)</p>
