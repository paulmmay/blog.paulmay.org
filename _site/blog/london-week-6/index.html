<p>Another week has flown by in London. This week we've been fortunate enough to <a href="http://www.ameliechucky.cl/">Marcela</a> staying with us. She's a Chilean who I met in New York who came to London from Switzerland to renew her US visa (nothing is ever simple with US visas). She leaves tomorrow, and we'll miss her.</p>

<p>In tangentially-related news, I'll be visiting New York at the beginning of September for work, and also to see family and friends. Plans are still coming together, but I'm looking forward to the trip.</p>

<p>Work has been going well. We're slowly ironing out some of the technical issues associated with me doing work for a New York-based hospital. We made a lot of progress this week, thanks to a few key people in New York. I am lucky to work with such great people.</p>

<p>Cliona is in Dublin this weekend visiting family, and on Sunday I am hoping to catch up with the folks from <a href="http://www.attopartners.com">Atto</a> who'll be in town. Can't wait.</p>
