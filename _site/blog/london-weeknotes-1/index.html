		<p>It's been a very positive first full week in London.</p>

<p>Even though we've left New York, I'm going to continue working with Sloan-Kettering from London. I am really delighted about that. My working day in London overlaps with New York by about 4 hours, which is perfect - lots of time for us to collaborate, then lots of time for heads-down work.</p>

<p>Over the the coming year my focus will be on designing experiences/agents (nimble little products) that use some of the wonderful knowledge available at MSKCC to help the hospital plan for the future, and make good day-to-day decisions.</p>

<p>This week I've just been getting set up. I've moved into a very nice co-working space in Hackney, and have been getting my desk and micro-office set up. The space overlooks the site of the 2012 Olympic Games, which is currently being redeveloped as a public park.</p>

<p>Next week, I'll finish getting set up. Then, it'll be down to some real work.</p>

<h3>Quickies</h3>

<ul>
<li>I invested in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>, a fabulous text editor.</li>
<li>I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005QVZ79C/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">this monitor</a> for my desk.</li>
<li>I have started using <a href="http://instagram.com/paulmayorg/">Instagram</a>, despite my queasiness about their terms and conditions. My real photos will still be uploaded to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/">Flickr</a>.</li>
<li>I have still not scanned any of the photos I took in May or June.</li>
<li>I am taking <a href="https://class.coursera.org/matrix-001/">this class</a> on linear algebra. So far, it's not much fun.</li>
<li>I am 60% of the way through 1Q84.</li>
