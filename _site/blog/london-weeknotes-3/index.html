		<p>I spent last weekend in Ireland; at a wedding in Longford on the Saturday, and in Dublin on the Sunday. The weather in Ireland is roasting. The country really shines in the sun. The landscape sparkles, people are happy and friendly, and there's a sense of optimism about the place that's sometimes absent in the greyer months. It was a real pleasure to see Ireland at its best.</p>

<p>While I was in Dublin, I got to meet Mr. Jack Holland, newly arrived son of Therese Veale and Derek Holland. He is a dote of the highest order, well-mannered to boot, and his parents were a sight for sore eyes.</p>

<p>I managed to get a spot on a return bus for the <a href="http://southwarkcyclists.org.uk/news/dunwich-dynamo-xxi-2013-faqs-essentials">Dunwich Dynamo</a>, an overnight ride from London to Dunwich, Suffolk. It's 120 miles, or about 200Km. I haven't done a cycle of that length in quite a while, but I'm told it's pretty flat.</p>

<p>I've been using the same cycling gear since about 2008, and having left a lot of it in the US, or disposed of it altogether, it was time to get new stuff. I bought myself a new jersey, shorts, helmet, shoes - and some other bits and pieces. Thanks to Alex at Swift Cycles in London for helping me choose and fit the gear properly.</p>

<p>Work is going pretty well. Design and development of two products is proceeding nicely.</p>

<h3>Quickies</h3>

<ul>
<li>My linear algebra practice has being getting scant attention. I am sorry linear algebra gods.</li>
<li>I am 90% of the way through 1Q84. I don't get a sense that it'll end satisfactorily. I can't say it's been among my favourite Murakami books; it needs a damn good editing.</li>
</ul>
