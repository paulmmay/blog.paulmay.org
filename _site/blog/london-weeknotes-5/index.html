		<p>Busy week. Desire to turn off computer for the evening. All quickies.</p>

<h3>Quickies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Last weekend we took a trip to the British Museum. It's astounding. The Rosetta Stone is jawdropping. The number of tourists in the British Museum jostling to get a terrible, flash-lit photograph of the Rosetta Stone is jawdropping, in a very different way. The British Museum is wall to wall loot, and tourists clambering over and photographing said loot in a frenzy.</li>
<li>We had a very tasty breakfast at Towpath Cafe, then visited Columbia Road Flower Market, and Hackney City Farm (see Duck, above). Gorgeous, gorgeous.</li>
<li>Cliona has been interviewing for jobs, and has made very good progress - news soon.</li>
<li>We've been tip-toeing our way through the latest episodes of Breaking Bad. It's so, so, so good. Probably the most compelling TV show I've ever watched.</li>
<li>I am making progress with yoga. I am still the sweaty beginner in the class, but I can feel myself getting stronger. Less painful vibration as I hold simple poses. Result.</li>
<li>A so-so week at work. Nobody said this was going to be easy.</li>
