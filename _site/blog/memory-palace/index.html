<p class="intro">A short audio piece in response to visits to the Brooklyn Historical Society, The New York City Reliquary and the Tenement Museum.</p>


<h3>Concept</h3>

<p>The three museums we visited recently draw together stories and objects to tell us about the lives of ordinary people; simple physical objects used to link the visitor to deeper stories.</p>

<p>This format reminded me of the Memory Palace mnemonic technique; the placement of imagined objects in an imagined space as a way of remembering a large amount of information. Recalling the information becomes a journey through an imagined space, rather than rote-recall. To explore this I asked three volunteers to close their eyes, and walk through the homes they grew up in - describing the spaces and objects they saw.</p>

<h3>The Project, Results</h3>

<object height="81" width="100%"> <param name="movie" value="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11687440"></param> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess="always" height="81" src="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F11687440" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%"></embed> </object>

<p>I was surprised that their recollections  of these spaces, objects, textures, materials - seemed so detailed; I would have a hard time describing the room I left ten minutes ago.</p>

<p>Another thing I thought was interesting was the feeling I got that this type of recollection sat somewhere between remembrance and imagination/construction - I'm aware from the tiny bit of reading on neuroscience that the physical process of recalling a memory changes it <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/12/rewriting_fearful_memories_by_bringing_them_back_to_mind.php" title="through a process called re-consolidation">through a process called re-consolidation</a>. One participant even stated that they seemed to be remembering the home as they wanted it to be, before it had been renovated, and not as it actually existed now.</p>

<p>All in all, this was a very interesting exercise. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
