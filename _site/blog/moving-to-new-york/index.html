		<p class="intro">In September 2010 I'll be taking up a place at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) as a Fulbright award winner. Two years in New York? Yes please.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/4443711070/" title="ITP Corridor by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4001/4443711070_33cd517237.jpg" class="photo " alt="ITP Corridor" /></a></p>

<p>I am very happy to announce that me and Cliona are relocating to New York for a couple of years. I'll be heading off in late August, and Cliona will follow me in the Autumn.</p>

<p>Why are we going? Well, I've been very fortunate to get into NYU's <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/sigs/program/" title="Interactive Telecommunications Program">Interactive Telecommunications Program</a> (ITP). <strong>ITP is a master's degree that I've wanted to do for many years</strong> - I'll have a chance to learn from people like <a href="http://www.shirky.com">Clay Shirky</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159200346X/physicalcompu-20/002-1410032-7298416?creative=125577&amp;camp=2321&amp;link_code=as1">Tom Igoe</a>, <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/">Daniel Shiffman</a>, <a href="http://www.smoothware.com/danny/" title="Daniel Rozin">Daniel Rozin</a> and collaborate with other students to research and build networked toys, useful tools and online experiences. Right up my street.</p>

<p>Aside from my quest to go and do ITP, this is <strong>a great opportunity for both me and Cliona to have a lot of fun together</strong> in a new city. We have always talked about living and working outside of Ireland for a while, and it seems like the perfect time to give it a try. We're both leaving behind <a href="http://www.designbyfront.com" title="great jobs">great jobs</a>, and will miss our friends and families immensely - but this is one of those once-in-a-lifetime chances that we are both excited to pursue. It's an adventure for both of us.</p>

<h3>Fulbright</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/4731008997/" title="Fulbright Presentation by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1410/4731008997_3e6395d430_z.jpg" alt="Fulbright Presentation" class="photo"></a><br />
This (pretty major leap into the unknown) is all made possible because I've been very fortunate to win a <strong><a href="http://fulbright.ie/" title="Fulbright â€“ Enterprise Ireland Award in Science, Technology and Innovation">Fulbright</a></strong> Award in Science Technology and Innovation, which will help fund ITP; I'm being presented with the award in Dublin today. It's an incredible honour to have been chosen from the many applicants who compete every year in for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright_Program" title="Fulbright scholarship">Fulbright</a>. I want to say a huge thank you to the Fulbright Commission of Ireland - I will try not to let you down.</p>

<p>So, that is all the big news. There is still quite a bit of time before either of us set sail, but we thought you would like to know nice and early.</p>
