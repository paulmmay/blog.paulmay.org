		<p class="intro">For my Nature of Code class I'm going to make a little application that stores and represents information about little pieces of ephemera I find around my home. I call it Jetsom. </p>


<p>I am getting to the end of my time at ITP; it's been an amazing two years. I am going to use my Nature of Code midterm, and probably final as a way to look back at the last few years through data and representation.</p>

<p>Like a lot of people I seem to accumulate a lot of little items of paper and card; receipts, fliers, bills, menus. I keep some items deliberately because they represent memorable events, but most of it just accumulates - I've come to think of this as a form of <strong>inadvertent record keeping</strong>.</p>

<p>For my Nature of Code project I'm going to <strong>find</strong> every item of this ephemera I can find in my home. I'm going to <strong>scan</strong> each item, creating an image, and then <strong>store</strong> this image and any useful information I know about the item in a database.</p>

<p>I'll <strong>feed</strong> this data into Processing, and <strong>represent</strong> the data using computer graphics and sound. I would like the items to have aesthetic qualities and behaviours related to their origin - so I'll use data related to the item and a <strong>physics</strong> engine to power these qualities e.g. each new item finds other similar items, or flocks with items from the same time period.</p>

<p>My goal for the mid-term project is to find the physical items, scan and catalogue a subset of them, pull data into processing and represent them in some simplistic way. Over time I'll add more complexity.</p>

<p>I'll write more about the project over the next few weeks.</p>
