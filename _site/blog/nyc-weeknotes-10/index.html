<p>What an amazing week. I've been in the US since Saturday.</p>

<p>I spent the weekend with Simon, Amy, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/7916834928/">Trotsky</a> in Allentown, which was lovely. We ate great food, watched Total Recall <em>and</em> Predator. Super chilled and fun times.</p>

<p>On Monday, me and Simon took part in a 36-mile bike race, the Donut Derby. In the Derby, racers have 3 minutes deducted off their time for <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_qhfpUmZ6R-c/TJBMl7tCk8I/AAAAAAAACzM/loE08IokCEQ/s1600-h/DSCN1439%5B5%5D.jpg">every donut eaten</a> at the rest stops.</p>

<p>Me and Simon managed a total of 6 donuts each. We then managed to get lost - adding 5 miles onto our race, and wiping out both our donut-adjusted time, and our chances of finishing in the respectable half of the field. Next year I am going to pay closer attention to the road markings, bring a GPS device, and eat more donuts. It was still a great ride, and was actually the first time me and Simon have been on bikes together since we were kids.</p>

<p>On Tuesday I relocated to New York, and spent the working week meeting with the folks at MSKCC. In the evenings I got to spend time with my <a href="http://fredtruman.com/spring-2011-show-photo">super-amazing NYC friends</a>, eat <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2008/06/new-york-citys-top-10-best-ice-cream-sandwiches-nyc.html">ice-cream sandwiches</a>, <a href="http://www.oldebrooklynbagelshop.com/">eat delicious bagels</a>, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/dough-brooklyn">eat more donuts</a>, go to <a href="http://www.armoryonpark.org/programs_events/detail/the_machine">the theatre</a>, and see <a href="http://www.pianosnyc.com/upstairs">some great live music</a>. The whole week was like a highlights reel of everything I love about New York. I didn't get to see everybody I'd like to see, but I hope to be back soon. Special thanks to Ross and Natalie for letting me stay with them for a couple of nights.</p>

<p>I'm at Newark airport now, heading to Dublin via London. Tomorrow I get to see my family and my Dublin friends, attend Kevin Cannon's birthday, and see Verona Riots in concert.</p>

<p>I'll be back at home in Oxford on Sunday night. Maybe on Monday I will not get on a plane, or cross a border.</p>

<p>Life is good at the moment.</p>
