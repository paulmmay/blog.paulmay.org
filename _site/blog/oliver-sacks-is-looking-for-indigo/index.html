<p>In his talk at The Cooper Union last Friday, Oliver Sacks described his use of hallucinogenic drugs in his search for the colour indigo:</p>

<blockquote><p>There were many different motives; it was all a long time ago. It was all between '63 and '67. I had been puzzling about indigo. Indigo was inserted into the spectrum by Newton, so was orange; he felt there should be seven colours as there are seven notes in the musical scale, but it seemed to me that no two people agreed what indigo was like - and it was felt in fact that the pigment derived from the indigo plant was not really indigo. I decided I wanted to see indigo. I couldn't imagine it, but I thought I might be able to hallucinate it so I built a sort of pharmacological launchpad. A base of amphetamine, then some LSD, with a little cannabis on top. It got me fairly pickled; stoned is the right word.</p>

<p>When I felt ready I said "I want to see indigo <em>now!</em>" and as if thrown by a paintbrush, a trembling, pear-shaped blob of the most wonderful colour appeared on the wall. <em>Indigo</em>. It not only seemed wonderfully luminous, but it filled me with a sort of mystical - almost religious joy. I felt it was numinous as well as luminous, and although I'm an old Jewish atheist I thought "this is the colour of heaven" and I thought "this is the colour which Gioto tried to get but never could, and maybe this is a colour that no longer exists on the earth". And I leant forward in a sort of ecstasy and it vanished.</p>

<p>I felt very heartbroken, and in fact for months afterwards I would turn over little stones and things. I was looking for indigo.</p>

<p>I did experience it once again and that was when I came to New York in '65 I went to a concert in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the Egyptology gallery and in the first half of the concert there was some Monteverdi which transported me and it was sort of rapture. In the interval I wandered into the Egyptology gallery and saw there was some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_lazuli">lapis lazuli</a> amulets and so-forth and some of them were indigo and I thought "thank god - it exists in the world".</p>

<p>In the second half of the concert I didn't like the music much. I became a little bored and irritable, I thought I'd go and get a sip of indigo, but when I went back the lapis lazuli was just blue and mauve and puce and I've never seen indigo again.</p></blockquote>

<p>He finished the story:</p>

<blockquote><p>I knew it would have to be a blue of some sort. So I pre-determined it. I didn't say I want to see indigo and then see a splotch of orange. So I played a part, then it took this leap, helped by the launchpad, from imagination to hallucination.</p>

<p>Incidentally I'm not recommending the experience, although if you can get it from music, or from falling in love, or from medication, or from scenery - that's really a much better way. I'm glad I survived my drug period, many of my friends didn't.</p></blockquote>
