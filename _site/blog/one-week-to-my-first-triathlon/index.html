<p>Swimming this morning focused on getting my body rotation correct, and it's a pesky technique to master. Basically, rotating your body when you swim means that you're only pushing one side of your torso through the water, as oppsed to two. Rotating also helps reach the arms out further before pulling through the water; meaning more power.  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/e8kf8" target="_parent">This site</a> explains more about the technique, and has an excellent video example showing swimming with/without rotation.</p>

<p>In other news I met up with the rest of the team from work who are doing the triathlon last night to take team photos and talk about fundraising. Everybody is excited, and training well. 5 of us are 1 week away from our first Triathlon, a sprint-distance (500m swim, 20k bike, 5k run) event. I will definitely try the swim and cycle parts, but the run will depend on whether i get the go ahead from my physio on Monday. Fingers crossed, and good luck to the rest of the team.</p>
