		<p>A week of solid progress on work projects; things are starting to get very interesting - that point of a project where big chunks start knitting together.</p>

<p>I trained lightly this week. I'm starting to plan ahead for the winter, and have just been trying to keep things ticking over. I'd like to focus on swimming and running this winter.</p>

<p>The week culminated in a long cycle from Oxford to Brighton, and then a lovely weekend in Brighton. The cycle should have been about 160K, but between meandering and free-form navigation, it ended up being 192K door-to-door, and about 7.5 hours on the bike. The journey wasn't particularly tough on the legs, but the constant navigation was mentally taxing. I was glad to get off the bike.</p>

<p>The weekend in Brighton was very nice; it's a really interesting town. Charming, hip, and a little faded around the edges; a mix of seaside tack and a graphic designer insurgency. Definitely somewhere I'd like to explore more. We stayed in a lovely <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1082800">AirBnB</a> just outside the town. Highly recommended; incredibly friendly host, wonderful breakfast.</p>

<p>What else. Took lots of photos, saw people kitesurfing in the middle of a bloody gale. Ate fish and chips.</p>

<p>Successful week.</p>
