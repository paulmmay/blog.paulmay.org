<p>I grew up on the Northside of Dublin and never really spent any time in the Phoenix Park, but now that I live a bit closed to the centre of town it's a beautiful resource to have right on my doorstep. It's especially nice in the morning when it's basically runners, cyclists, people flying kites and planes - and the deer. The learner drivers come later in the day, thankfully when most of us are off the roads.</p>

<p>We met up today at 10am at the Papal Cross and did circuits inside of the park for about an hour and fifteen minutes. Thanks to Noelle from Piranha for leading the session. It felt really good and is the longest cycling session I've done so far. I got a windproof jacket yesterday which kept me warm, and the plan is to cycle to work twice a week from this week. My leg/back weren't too tight afterwards, which is good - and i made a bit of an effort to work on my left side while we were cycling.</p>

<p>The coming week is "ass in gear week" - physio, cycling, swimming, and easing slowly back into running.</p>
