		<p class="intro">A project proposal for a self-care system that monitors a swimmer's form in the water and offers instant feedback. </p>


<h3>Brief</h3>

<p>In my DIY Health class we have been <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/~sd107/diyhealth/2011/11/07/week-8-designing-a-self-care-system/" title="self-care system brief">asked to design a system</a> that allows us to &#8220;take stock of ourselves, set goals and act upon our health and lifestyle enabling systematic, ongoing analysis and progression towards goals&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The project is meant to be speculative - the end result is a thoroughly designed and described system and a video of how the system would be used. We can imagine ourselves at a point in the near future if we like.</p>

<h3>My Concept</h3>

<p>My goal is to design a device or system that can help me improve my swimming form by monitoring the position of my body in the water, offering feedback in real-time and facilitating analysis of my swimming form over a longer period of time.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>I am really <strong>interested in the complexity of swimming as a physical activity</strong>; it's pretty startling that we're able to do it at all. When I swim front crawl <strong>I am trying to balance the movement of my hands, arms, body and legs to move through the water</strong>. When I'm swimming effectively, these things are in balance and become unconscious actions.</p>

<p>When I need to improve my swimming form, I have to become aware of a particular aspect of my swimming stroke to coax it in a different direction - I receive an instruction before I swim from a coach, I drill a particular aspect of my form, or (on very rare occasions) I look back on a piece of video.</p>

<p>The initial motivation behind this project is the opportunity, as I see it, <strong>to provide feedback to a swimmer in real time; connecting them to their physical movements in a natural, intimate way</strong>. By doing this, it's my hope that swimming becomes more efficient (expending less energy as I move through the water) and more natural (improving gradually while I'm in the water in a way that reduces the need to constantly drill individual aspects of my stroke).</p>

<p>Inspiration
In my early research for this project<strong> I've looked at the ways in which fish and other sea creatures move through water and fluidly make adjustments to their speed and course</strong>; I like the idea that in some alternative evolutionary path humans could have retained a much closer connection to water - maybe we would have the capabilities to move through it in more fish-like ways, or maybe we'd be able to communicate or breathe in water. There may be natural systems that I can learn from as I do this project.</p>

<p>I've also been inspired by the writings of Jacques Cousteau; In The Silent World he describes his first use of the aqualung in such a beautiful way:</p>

<blockquote>From this day forward we would swim across miles of country no man had known, free and level, with our flesh feeling what the fish scales know
</blockquote>


<p>In Cousteau's case, technology had literally allowed him to enhance his evolved, human capabilities. I have started to think about the goal of my system in a more lyrical sense - the system should make <strong>me feel more connected to the environment of the water and allow me to become more fish-like</strong>.</p>

<h3>Key Components</h3>

<p>The key component of the system will probably be <strong>a wearable device</strong>, worn during swimming, which measures angles of rotation around a number of axes, and motion. The device will give me feedback in the form of vibration and/or sound to signal good form or a correction/action of some kind.</p>

<p>The second component of the system is a <strong>communications layer</strong>; essentially a way to get information from the wearable device to a computer. This could be done using a physical connection or a wireless link.</p>

<p>The third component of the system is a piece of <strong>software</strong> that allows me to configure the wearable device; setting new goals/parameters and analyze my previous swimming sessions. This could be a standalone piece of software, or it could be a web service. It might have a social component or it might not.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>I want to design my system to monitor a small number of key physical components of the swim stroke so I am doing research into the biomechanics of swimming in both humans and animals.</p>

<p>I'm also mapping out how the system would work from end to end - from the moment I get up in the morning to go to the pool to the analysis after my swim, building a picture of my swimming form over months and years. It's an exciting challenge.</p>

<p>I'll write about the project as it progresses.</p>
