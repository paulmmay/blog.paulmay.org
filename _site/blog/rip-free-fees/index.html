<p class="intro">The Irish government has realised that, being as it is already wildly unpopular, the time is ripe to re-introduce college fees. Sure, won't it be a nice little earner in these tough times.</p>


<h3>The Mists of Time</h3>

<p>Let me set the scene for you. In 1995 the then coalition government of Labour and Fine Gael abolished third level college fees in a straightforward bid to win votes in marginal, middle-class constituencies.</p>

<p>The move <strong>was sold as a means of increasing access to education</strong>; but something was fishy in the state of Ireland. The scheme appeared from nowhere&#8230;like from <i>nowhere</i>; from inception to announcement took a matter of weeks. It was never really clear how the costs of the scheme would impact on investment in education as a whole, and the move wasn't accompanied by new structures in at primary and post-primary level to feed students from disadvantaged areas through to college. It was a rush job, a big, expensive, incredibly popular rush job.</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>

<p>In real terms, the free fees scheme proved to be <strong>a massive subsidy to families who could already afford to send children to college</strong>. Don't ask me, ask the OECD! Their <a href="http://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.education.ie%2Fservlet%2Fblobservlet%2Foecd_review_national_policies_education.doc&amp;ei=bnVbSpmMLpKNjAf67fga&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqnlJER-7o0RR68_R56dNuIkBv2w&amp;sig2=XJdkD0YVFOAxb5xIN0ApHA" title="report into the Irish education system">OECD report into the Irish education system</a> (check out page 56 if you're interested) states:</p>

<p><q>No evidence was produced throughout our Review that the decision in 1995 to remit fees for first degree study had more than a limited, if any, impact on the disparity of participation rates amongst the different social/occupational classes.</q></p>

<h3>Life at the Coal-Face</h3>

<p>Now, you might think about kicking up a fuss about this - outrageous, no change in the number of disadvantaged students entering third level despite years of the free fees scheme - but remember, the free fees scheme wasn't designed to help disadvantaged people -<strong> that would have required, you know, structures, resources, a plan</strong>. I saw this for myself when I was in DCU, where every year, without fail, its <a href="http://www.dcu.ie/students/access/" title="Access Programme">Access Programme</a> struggled to resource a very modest scheme to support students from local schools.</p>

<p>In the Students' Union at the time we took the <i>somewhat </i>cowardly approach of publicly supporting the free fees scheme (or at least never saying that it wasn't working) even though in private conversation we talked about how it was broadening the gap between rich and poor. We saw at first hand that the government was actually paying for the &#8220;free&#8221; scheme by reducing investment in all education in real terms, and by charging a whole lot of money at the point of registration each year. I was hard to argue that third-level was adequately funded, and that a new source of income wouldn't be hugely welcome.</p>

<h3>Drumroll Please</h3>

<p>So, here we are. 14 years on from the announcement of the free fees scheme. The government has seized the opportunity (it could hardly be any less popular, and we could hardly be any more broke) to <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0711/1224250466444.html" title="re-introduce fees">re-introduce fees</a> through a student loan scheme. This is going to happen; Batt O'Keefe, a man with no real future within Fianna F&aacute;il, is here to do a dirty job, then shuffle off into retirement.&nbsp; <strong>He's taking one for the team</strong>. Weirdly enough, news of the end of the free fees scheme is being spun in the same way as its introduction; as a means of widening access to education.</p>

<h3>Predictions</h3>

<p>Here are a few predictions I see coming true in the next 3 years:</p>

<ol>
* The student loan scheme will be introduced in 2010. (No points there)
* Between now and its re-introduction, debate will shift almost entirely towards ensuring third-level is free for all &#8220;at the point of entry&#8221; (even though ongoing costs like food, books, rent are far more significant than entry costs)
* The money generated by the scheme won't be ring-fenced for investment in third-level education.
* Some money will be put towards increasing participation in education by the disadvantaged - but not much.
* In the short term we'll see far more students applying for courses at Russell Group/Ivy League colleges - if you're paying for university, why not go the whole hog.
* In the medium term, the number of graduates emigrating directly after graduation will increase, especially medical, science and technology graduates.
* The government will lose the next election&#8230;by a lot, but free fees will not be re-introduced by the opposition, and the scheme will remain practically unchanged.
</ol>


<p>Like everybody else, I'm looking forward to the day when education is a genuine priority in Ireland, when it's free - completely free for everybody, and recognised as being a great investment. I'm not going to hold my breath though. Onwards, to the election.</p>
