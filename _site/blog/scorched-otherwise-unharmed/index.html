<p class="intro">An epic journey from Dublin to Kilkenny par bicyclette leads to a crispy sun tan; but all in all a really enjoyable cycle.</p>


<h3>Before</h3>

<p>Hey there. I'm gearing up for a cycle to Kilkenny this Saturday - a long enough cycle for me, but chicken feed for some of the serious wheelers out there. Along the way I'll be taking in glamourous destinations such as Tallaght, Blessington, Tullow, Carlow and Paulstown. Exciting stuff! I think the route is about 140K, so I'll be doing it in two chunks, Dublin to Tullow and then Tullow to Kilkenny. "Why don't you take the train?" I hear you say&#8230;.well, I'm trying to train as much as possibly at the moment (a rare, injury-free window and good weather), and I'm up for a bit of a challenge.</p>

<p>Kilkenny is the destination because a few of us are heading down to see <a href="http://www.myspace.com/veronariots">Verona Riots</a> who are supporting KidIc. I'm getting the train back on Sunday of course&#8230;I'm not totally crazy. Have a good weekend, get out there, the weather is going to be lovely.</p>

<p>After
Hello. I made it to Kilkenny in about 5 hours on the bike. (3017 Kcal with an average heart rate of 133&#8230;if you're bothered) I took a slightly different route than originally planned, turning off before I got to Tullow, then getting slightly lost - then making it to Carlow for lunch.  I did the last 35K to Kilkenny as the day went from warm to hot - and my forearms went from pale to red raw. I didn't wear sunscreen, which was a really silly thing to do. I'm rationalising it now on the basis that if I had put it on before I left it would have been gone a few hours later anyway&#8230;.that's my story anyway.</p>

<p>The B&amp;B in Kilkenny was lovely, Bridge Court House - recommended. Nice room, nice breakfast, no hassle, and not expensive at all. The Italian restaurant we went to <em>Italian Connection</em> (dodgy name) was good too; nice Italian food served in a dark, bustling dining room. Good service, nice coffee, not expensive. After dinner we went to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cleeres+kilkenny" target="_blank">Cleere's for a drink</a>, then onto Zoo for the gig (see next paragraph). After the gig we went to Morrisons, which was sweaty and dangerously overcrowded and kind of like <a href="http://www.dublinpubscene.com/thepubs/copperfacejacks.html" target="_blank">Coppers</a> with more leather, plasma screens. At 2.30am Kilkenny, like most other Irish towns, belches thousands of people (myself included) out onto the streets at exactly the same moment - leading to the ususal hilarious shenanigans.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main event was the Verona Riots gig at Zoo. They were supporting Kidic, who weren't really my cup of tea, but who obviously know how to put tab A into slot B. Verona Riots were urgent and loud and have that something different - I'm biased, I know the band, but even if they weren't to my taste I'd appreciate the craft of the songs and lyrics. They're headlining The Sugar Club this Sunday night, so I'll head along to that. That's all for now.</p>
