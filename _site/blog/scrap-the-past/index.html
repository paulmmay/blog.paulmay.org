		<p class="intro">This week I wanted to do something interesting with analogue input into Arduino. The discovery of an old Walkman on the ITP junk shelf inspired me to take a trip into the past. The result is Scrap the Past - a Scrap Saturday visualisation machine.

<h3>The Past on Tape</h3>

<p>One of the sentimental items I brought from Ireland is <strong>a tape of <a href="Saturday" title="Scrap Saturday">Scrap Saturday</a></strong>; a weekly radio programme that ran from 1989 to 1991 which satirsed Irish politics and public life . It was <em>massively</em> popular and we'd listen to it as a family in the kitchen most weekends. Back then I had the good sense to record some of the episodes of Scrap Saturday onto a cassette tape; I probably haven't listened to the tape in 10 years, probably more. I haven't owned a tape player in probably just as long.</p>

<p>While rummaging around on the junk shelf at ITP I happened to find an old Sony Walkman - <strong>a perfect little piece of previously-loved technology</strong>. I first thought the Walkman would give me a chance to listen to the tape again, and then I thought of using it as part of my physical computing homework; which this week deals with analogue inputs into the Arduino microcontroller. A good fit :)</p>

<h3>Visualising Audio - Scrap the Past Version 1</h3>

<p>I wanted to create something that would let me <strong>see</strong> the contents of the tape, as well as listen to it - so I took a standard set of headphones, and used the cable as an input into the Arduino (through a capacitor). This was quite tricky - I spent a good bit of time stripping the annoying insulation from the headphone wires, and soldering on breadboard-friendly terminals.</p>

<p>When the breadboard was wired I wrote a little programme to let the Arduino<strong> listen to the value of the analogue input, and push out a corresponding signal to an LED and a little speaker</strong>. Here is version one of Scrap the Past - my Scrap Saturday visualisation machine.</p>

<h3>Building Version 2</h3>

<p>It was really exciting to see version 1 working. I took the concept forward another step, and added a bar of 8 LEDs to visualise the signal coming from the Arduino. <strong>The wiring for this was a little fiddly - a lot of wires and resistors in a small space</strong>, but I got there in the end. After some trial and error I added a 22Kohm resistor between the capacitor and the Arduino - which helped with some odd values I was getting (the input from the headphones appeared to be drifiting up and up, getting louder and louder - maybe the capacitor was retaining charge or something? I will investigate anyway).</p>

<p>The programme for this took a good bit of trial and error; <strong>I realised that I couldn't hardcode values for the strength of the signal coming into the Arduino</strong> - because the volume could be set to any level. Effectively what the programme does is listen for the loudest signal from the Walkman, and divides that value into 8 chunks. So, if I play the Walkman and get a volume of 80, each LED will come on at every increment of 10. If I am pushing higher volume into the Arduino, the chunks will be larger. After about 5 hours of graft and tinkering, it works; the Walkman plays the old tape into the Arduino, and the signal is converted back out to a fun little strip of LEDs.</p>

<h3>Scrap the Past - In Action</h3>

<p>This was a fun little project, and has given me <strong>an excuse/opportunity to listen back and remember something from home.</strong> (The contents of the tape will only make sense if you're Irish and were around in the late 80s/early 90s.) I learned a lot about the hardware and software of Arduino in the process too.</p>

<p><strong>Update (22/09/2010):</strong> <a href="http://paulmay.org/images/uploads/sketch_sep18_scrapsaturday_plus.pde">Here is the Arduino sketch for this</a>; would be really happy to take feedback - definitely room for improvement using an array of LED outputs and a loop (most of the time was spent on the hardware).</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Update 23/09/10:</strong> It turns out I totally misunderstood the purpose of the capacitor and the resistors that lead back to the Arduino; the resistors divide the voltage - eliminating the negative voltage from the DC input from the line-in. The capacitor smooths out the voltage. I had thought the capacitor was doing the voltage division and the resistors were doing the smoothing. Electronics make my head hurt :)</p>
