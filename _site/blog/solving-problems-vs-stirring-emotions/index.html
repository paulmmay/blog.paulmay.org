<p class="intro">My first week at ITP has been great, and has also asked me to challenge the way I think about problem solving and creativity.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/4949420441/" title="ITP Welcome Party by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/4949420441_8c77aaf7cf_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="ITP Welcome Party" /></a><br />
This week, on more than one occasion, we've been told that what makes ITP special is a coming together of a diverse and talented group of people in a space that fosters collaboration and creativity. Our teachers are there to guide us, provoke us, offer feedback - but that <strong>ultimately we are free to tailor our work along whatever path we choose</strong> to explore new forms of media. Great, and terrifying, and great and also terrifying.</p>

<p>With a blank piece of paper, <strong>I am inclined to want to solve a problem</strong>. I will ask people about themselves, ask about their frustrations, gain whatever insight I can into what they struggle with - and then try to solve some aspect of the person's problem. I will do this through writing; breaking down the problem into clearer language, defining smaller sub-problems, working the problem like play-dough, describing it and potential solutions. I then work with others to express a solution to that problem as a <em>thing</em>.</p>

<p>At ITP we are more than free to solve problems, we can solve them all day long if that's what we choose to do - but we can also challenge the way people think about their environment, go against the grain of a trend, provoke a reaction or stir an emotion. This week has been challenging, because I've been shown that really great things can be created that don't necessarily map back to a problem that somebody has with the world**.</p>

<h3>What's Next</h3>

<p>In the next few months, years I will no doubt retain my own preference for practical problem solving, but I want to leave myself open to the idea that I'll make things that speak to something more personal and emotional as well. I am really happy that within days of coming to ITP I have had the chance to challenge my default outlook.</p>

<p>Here's a collection of stuff I've seen this week that has me thinking - you can decide for yourself whether it solves a problem, or raises an eyebrow.</p>
