		<p>A busy week, a tiring week. While Cliona was settling into her new job, I stayed in London to tidy a few things up.</p>

<p>Yesterday I moved out of the co-working space in Hackney Wick, rented a little van, and drove our stuff up to Oxford. Our little house there is the bees' knees, and I'm looking forward to getting settled.</p>

<p>Today, I'm back in London to lock up our sublet in Hackney. Tomorrow morning I fly to the US. I am staying with Simon and Amy in Allentown for a couple of days, then I'll be in New York to see the good people at Sloan-Kettering.</p>

<p>Obituaries; not to become a regular feature.</p>

<p>This week we lost the founder of ITP, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/nyregion/red-burns-godmother-of-silicon-alley-dies-at-88.html">Red Burns</a>. The reaction to her death on the ITP Alumni mailing list has been quite intense. Some people loved Red. Some really didn't. I think there is a consensus that she was a hardworking, whip-smart, opinionated, and uncompromising woman.</p>

<p>We also lost <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13930435">Seamus Heaney</a>. At school we read and studied him, but I didn't hear him. Today, for the first time, I feel like I heard him.</p>
