		<p class="intro">&#8230;It was going to happen. I fell off my bike today while out on the usual Sunday cycle, taking another rider with me. </p>
<p>My left arm and leg took the brunt of the fall and I have some fairly juicy cuts and bruises. My bike also came off a bit worse for wear; torn grip tapes, torn saddle, a few scratches and bends here and there. Alan, the other rider ended up in the middle of the road, and it’s just lucky that there wasn’t a car coming at that particular moment. It was a bit scary, one minute flying along, the next minute in a tangle of bikes and gravel on the road.</p>

<p>Anyway, these things happen. No serious harm done, and nothing that’ll keep me off the bike for more than a day or two.</p>

<p>Myself and Ed went swimming at Seapoint on Saturday in some windy conditions. We covered a few hundred metres, but the conditions weren’t really too friendly, so we didn’t stay too long.</p>

<p>That’s the update for now, physio tomorrow and swimming on Tuesday.</p>
