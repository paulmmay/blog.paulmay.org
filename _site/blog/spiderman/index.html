<p>When a party starts with a death defying climb across a rooftop, you know it's going to be good. It's oh-six-hundred...what does the oh stand for? Oh my god it's early! So, I went to a party last night, and unfortunately, because my friends were on the roof, they didn't hear me buzz on the door when I arrived. Now fast forward to me persuading one of the residents to let me in because I had "forgotten my key". From this point on my intrepid journey led to the freight lift (elevator) which I took to the roof. So, I'm on the roof, but I'm on the opposite side of the roof to my friends' party. There's a field of rooftop tin buildings and air-conditioning units between me and them.</p>

<p>So, I climbed and clambered across the roof top, using fire escapes and gutters, following the music. I finally saw them after about 10 minutes of climbing, trying not to look down at the pavement 100 feet below. After one crab-like sideways dash on a gutter I was there...announcing my arrival to Pete, one of the party's revelers. I think "Holy Shit" were his words. There's really nothing better than arriving at a party by swinging down off a roof, six-pack at the ready. As I said before, this was the opening of a great night.</p>

<p>Spiderman style in Chicago, roof-top parties, and early mornings on my way to work. Enjoy your day...climb a roof today.</p>
