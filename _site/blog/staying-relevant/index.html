<p class="intro">There are some incredibly talented people working in technology, design, business - and I wondered how do these people stay so fresh, so highly skilled and so motivated when the nature of their industry and their business changes so quickly and so often. So I asked them; and gave a talk at Barcamp Belfast 2008 to discuss the findings.</p>


<h3>What is This All About</h3>

<ul type="disc">
* This is not a talk about technology
* This is not a talk about design
* This is hopefully something that will be useful for you in whatever part of the technology industry you happen to work in.

### Hypothesis
<ul type="disc">
* I have worked and studied with some very talented people over the years.
* I've met and talked to people from many really great companies
* Incredibly talented people; far smarter than I.
* I've often wondered, how do these people stay so fresh, so highly skilled and so motivated when the nature of their industry and their business changes so quickly and so often.
* So I asked them. And what they told me was very interesting.
* For some people it's a strategy, a plan
* In most cases these just happen to be some things that really great people seem to have in common.
* So, what are these traits, these strategies?

### Talented people understand the fundamentals of what they do
<ul type="disc">
* One of the common traits I found was that really good people apply the same behaviours, attitides and core insights to whatever they happen to be working on
* For most people, technology is about what is "now", but in most cases what is "now" will be irrlevant in 5 years.
* Technologies are useful in and of themselves, but also to expose the fundamentals of what you're trying to do.
* The basic premise is that most technologies rely on the same fundamental concepts
* Skills are transient, knowledge and perspective are timeless
<ul type="circle">
* Fundamental Concepts of Your Vocation
* Problem Solving
* Logical Thinking
* Teamworking
* Communication
* Commercial Awareness



### They live outside of their box
<ul type="disc">
* Specialism is great, if you are a heart surgeon or a bomb disposal I am perfectly happy for you to geek out to hearts or bombs and have nothing else going on in your life and to not care about the before and after
* The problem is also that if all you do is focus on what *you* do, all you can ever be is a shiny cog in a bigger machine.
* For the rest of us, having an insight into the people who influence the things you work on, and the people who work on or consume them seems to be a very good thing
* Being excellent at what you do is great, but to be able to put your work in a context that is relevant for others is incredibly powerful. Having a basic understanding of the challenges that face other people is hugely valuable.
* Understanding what other people value and the way in which they communicate is really really useful.
* The main message here is "Don't be the shiny cog"

### They are not vending machines
<ul type="disc">
* We come across this all the time
* I want a website, I need it done next week, I have X to spend (where X is not a lot of money)
* There is nothing wrong with this
* This is a transactional model or doing business - like putting coins into a machine and getting a generic product
* So long as you understand that this is the model you are working in, you can be incredibly successful at it
* Cost is likely to be the key differentiator - Consistent, reliable, cheap (price based)
* If this does not sound like the model you want to follow, then you have to find a way to articulate what you do in a way that goes beyond merely transactional
* Really successful people are able to articulate their skills/services/products in a way that is strategic for them. This could be transactional, but a lot of the time it isn't.

### They solve problems and "add value" alongside others
<ul type="disc">
* IDEO and Adaptive Path talk about using design to solve both human and business problems
* This is all the rage now; the idea of asking users and clients to help design the services they will eventually go on to use and consume
* It sounds a bit cheeky, but it works and it's actually a very old idea
* Model: Open design session, ethnographic research, puma customised runners, nike +, Flickr, practically any social networking site. The customer adds the critical insight, content and value; the "experts" provide a framework or a product which makes this relevant for other people.
* The most successful businesses happen to be partnerships between both sides, consumers and producers
* It moves the debate away from a buyer, seller model, away from the vending machine
* It lets you become an advisor, not just a cog.

### They are able to identify and evaluate trends
<ul type="disc">
* Easy to get caught up, Easy to be a cheerleader
* Difficult to say what is different, special, unique and worthwhile about a new trend or technology
* If you are able to articulate the merits, demerits of a new trend/technology and communicate that you are immediately demonstrating why you understand the fundamentals of what you do, and that you are not an unthinking vending machine
* Critical thinking is not the same as being a jackass/the devil's advocate

### They can write or communicate in some other way, very effectively
<ul type="disc">
* The ability to clearly and effectively communicate sets apart every designer, developer, other I have ever met
* The most useful classes I have ever taken have been on writing and public speaking
* The skills you use to write are the same skills you will use to structure design, code
* Being able to talk about your work, defend it, get ideas, give ideas to others means that you can never and will never become irrelevant
