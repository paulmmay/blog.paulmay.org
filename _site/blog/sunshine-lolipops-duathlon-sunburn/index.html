<p class="intro">It was a bank holiday weekend here this weekend, so I took it a little bit easier than usual. I had my feet measured and scanned on Saturday for insoles, which will hopefully put an end to the knee, back and leg pains that have been plaguing me.</p>


<p>Later on Saturday I met up with Ed, Pras and some of the other piranhas for a sea swim. I was dreading it a bit because of the bad swim at the 40 Foot the previous week, but it was much better this time. For a start, the sea was only about 5 feet deep, so I knew that I could stop if I got too tired. It was also a sunny day with no wind, so the water was a lot less choppy. I'm not sure what distance we covered, but it was probably about 500 metres, which we were all happy with. Swimming in the suit is something I'm still not used to, but the breathing was easier than before. Hopefully we can get out again next week and cover some greater distances.</p>

<p>On Sunday I was a marshall at the <a href="http://www.dublincityduathlon.com" target="_parent">Dublin City Duathlon</a> which was good fun (though I got a bit burned). It was good to see the way that the race and transition area worked. Well done to Ed who marshalled and then competed in the Supersprint event.</p>

<p>The cycling was moved to Monday, which would have meant I was cycling on Monday and swimming on Tuesday - which I don't really like to do; Monday being my usual day off training. So, no long cycle this weekend, but I got around on the bike a lot in the great weather, which kept me active.</p>

<p>Swimming this morning was good, I think we covered about 1800m again, which is pretty good going.</p>
