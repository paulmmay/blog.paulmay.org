<p class="intro">My terrifying first sea swim while training for my first triathlon</p>


<p>Saturday, got fitted for proper running shoes by Mick Dowling in Terenure; he seems to think I need insoles made - I think he'd know what he's talking about. Sunday, a pretty long cycle with some of the others from Piranha and 3D. I think we covered 70K+, roughly, at a fairly quick pace (I'm sure the more advanced people thought we were crawling).</p>

<p>And then to top off the weekend myself and Cliona went to the 40 Foot to try out my new wetsuit. Sam (Piranha) and Nessa (3D) were there to brave the cold water, along with the usual lunatics who partake in sea swimming here.</p>

<p>My wetsuit is pretty tight, and when I got in the water I felt warm - but found it very difficult to breathe. I paddled about a bit, but couldn't get my body into a good position - and basically when we got out into deeper water I got a bit &#8220;intimidated&#8221; (I bottled it) and went back to the shore. I don't know if the suit is supposed to be so tight, but the combination of the newness of sea swimming and the suit managed to freak me out a bit. Turning my head to breathe and finding a wave there was also an interesting experience. I'm sure I'll go and try again next week, hopefully I'll get used to the suit and the open water in time. Thanks to Sam and Nessa for keeping an eye on me in the water, and Cliona on the shore - it was much appreciated.</p>
