		<p class="intro">Hey! I'm very proud to say that we raised &#8364;2426 from the Table Quiz on Wednesday night; a really huge amount of money! Thank you to everybody who came and was so generous with their cash, and to our sponsors for donating all the really great prizes for the night (mountain bike! paintballing!).</p>
<p>We visited the team at Our Lady’s Hospital for Sick Children yesterday to talk about the work they do; and to talk about the journey to Chicago for the triathlon. Participants from previous years gave advice on the race and on coping with the heat, which is likely to be a bit more ferocious than we’re used to.</p>

<p>After visiting the hospital I went to the good folks at Wheelworx to have my bike converted to its race setup. I had tri-bars (aero-bars), a Fast Forward seat post, pedal clips and a computer fitted, as well as a second bottle cage. Oddly enough in just over a week or so I’ll have to break it all down again and pack the bike into a flight case for travel.</p>

<p>In two weeks from now I’ll be on the course in Chicago praying my legs hold out. 4 months of training, 2 weeks to go.</p>
