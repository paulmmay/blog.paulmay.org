<p class="intro"></p>


<p>The team of people taking part in the Chicago Triathlon met up on Wednesday to talk about fundraising, training, equipment, and logistics. It was nice to meet everybody; there's a great group of 10 people taking part,  so hopefully together we'll be able to raise some serious money and have fun.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the swimming this morning, and I'm starting to get an inkling for some of the technique. The slower and more deliberate I swim the easier I find the technique, and my endurance is slowly (very slowly) getting better.</p>

<p>And in other news, I had physiotherapy today after work, which went really well. I was very impressed with the team at Sports Med Ireland, who looked after me very well, gave me a thorough assessment and after doing some strength exercises, gave me some work to do between now and my next session. I can't say physio was "fun", but I'm glad that the problems with my back and left side were looked at.</p>
