Today was my first (and possibly last) class in Interpretive Exhibition Design with David Harvey; head of exhibits at the American Natural History Museum and Senior Exhibition Designer at the Metropolitan Museum. 
</p>
<p>In the class David asked us to think about the first time we visited a museum. I talked about the time my Dad took me to see the <strong>Chinese terracotta warriors</strong> at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham. This was, according to a quick internet search, in 1987. I only remembered this visit recently when I found myself in the hall where the exhibition had taken place all those years ago. The memories came back pretty clearly - the soft orange light, the chariots, the weapons, the spooky rows of soldiers. I remember the printed program for the exhibition and the lovely photographs of all the pieces; I wonder where that program is now - I’d love to see it.</p>

<p>(As it turns out that some high quality Irish scaffolding collapsed when the exhibition was on, <a href="http://www.independent.ie/national-news/china-gives-us-a-second-chance-with-art-exhibits-2060305.html" title="damaging six of the pieces">damaging six of the pieces</a>.)</p>

<p>The reason I say that this might be my first and last class is due to the fact that I’m number 10 on a waiting list to get into the class. With only 16 in the class it’s highly unlikely 10 people are going to drop out in front of me. A real shame; <strong>things really are jam packed at ITP this year - it’d be great if the powers that be could put on a second time for popular classes like Interpretive Exhibition Design</strong>. I am not holding my breath.</p>
