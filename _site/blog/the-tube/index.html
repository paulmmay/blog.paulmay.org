<p class="intro">Hello! I did the Port Tunnel run on Sunday, which was good fun. I haven't been running since the Dublin Aquathon back in September (?), so I was really bluffing it. Anyway, I made it home in a leisurely (read: crap) 59 mins&#8230;.7 minutes slower than my 10K leg in Chicago in August and about 30 minutes behind the decent runners.
</p>


<p>10 thousand people huddled together on the approach to the tunnel for 30 minutes listening to the interesting blend of a local radio station van blasting out every song with the word &#8220;run&#8221; in it (Born to Run, Run To You&#8230;etc.) and the Starter shouting at people to get off the grass verge and that they were only kidding themselves. All good fun.</p>

<p>We started running (jogging) into the tunnel; from the grey winter light and the icy wind outside to the warm sodium glow and balmy 18 degree air inside. The contrast was wild; people were ditching jackets, santa suits and tracksuit bottoms all over the place. A leisurely jog later and we were back outside in the real world. The medal is very nice, well done to the organisers.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to try the Aware 10K on Sunday in the Phoenix Park, see if I can beat my pedestrian time. I'll give it a go anyway.</p>

<p>Hope you're all well.</p>
