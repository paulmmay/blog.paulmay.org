<p class="intro">Noodling on the value of information to a political process. </p>


<p>I've just finished my first class in Data Representation. In this class we'll learn different techniques to identify, analyse and present data - physically, visually and sonically. I'd like to continue my <a href="http://irishdata.org" title="Irish Data ">Irish Data</a> project; expanding the database of unloved Irish data, cross-referencing it with other sources, representing it, getting more people involved in using it and sharing it. I think there's a lot of potential there.</p>

<p>While I was in the class I was day-dreaming about tonight's <a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0125/dail_tracker.html" title="passage">passage</a> of the <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=17389&amp;&amp;CatID=59" title="Finance Bill">Finance Bill</a> in the D&aacute;il.</p>

<p>Essentially, the passage of the bill (whether you like its contents or not) <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0125/breaking44.html" title="depends on the consent of some fairly minor characters">depends on the consent of some fairly minor characters</a> in Irish political life, independent TDs who exercise far more power than the size of their constituencies really mandates. This is a product of shaky, coalition government; this is what you get - it's not surprising that independents <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/0126/1224288327425.html" title="exercise the influence">exercise the influence</a> they have managed to gain.</p>

<p>What is really interesting, worrying perhaps (to me anyway), is the counter-factual way that Irish politics seems to work. Michael Lowry, one of the independent TDs in question was proven to have evaded tax and taken favours (in the form of <a href="http://www.tribune.ie/article/2010/sep/19/dunne-lowry-and-haughey-a-scandal-that-beat-them-a/" title="renovations to his home">renovations to his home</a>) from business contacts. Even though this is known, openly, widely - even though it's old, old news - he tops the poll in his constituency, in fact his share of the vote <a href="http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=3737&amp;sort=cons&amp;office=yes" title="has grown in step with revelations about his conduct">has grown in step with revelations about his conduct</a>.</p>

<p>There are many other examples in Irish political life where the <strong>information available on the conduct of a politician is totally at odds with their electoral performance</strong>. The most serious corruption seems not to trump tradition, family name, place of birth. I don't know why this is the case, I am sure it's really complicated - anthropological, personal, systematic - but it troubles me.</p>

<p>So, I come back around to the idea of open government, back to my firm conviction that <a href="/blog/ireland-as-pdf" title="Irish people need to have access to the raw information that informs our political processes"> Irish people need to have access to the raw information that informs our political processes</a>. <strong>I wonder if all the data visualisation/translation in the world would make a difference in the Irish context</strong>. It's maybe no wonder that information about Irish public life is so hard to find; we appear to have no use for it.</p>

<p>As I said; I'm noodling on this - it's interesting though. This is just one of those times when counter-factual Ireland swims clearly into view. I can't claim to understand it.</p>
