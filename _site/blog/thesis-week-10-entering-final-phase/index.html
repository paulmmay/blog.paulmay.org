<p class="intro">I'm entering the final 4 week phase of my project; wrapping up. </p>


<p>This week I <strong>completed functional work on the prototype web application</strong> related to my thesis; the app is now feature-complete (it does everything I identified as being critical to the delivery of the service to patients). The final piece of the puzzle was the implementation of a daily text message sent to a patient's phone with feedback on the previous day's exercise and encouragement to be active. This is what is sometimes called a &#8220;<a href="http://www.behaviormodel.org/triggers.html" title="hot trigger">hot trigger</a>&#8221; in persuasive systems design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Monday I <strong>presented the project to my Thesis classmates</strong> at ITP. I essentially summarised the background to the project, the different phases I had worked through and the results to date. The response was very positive. I'm proud of where I've managed to get to in 10 weeks, and I've learned a huge amount about my own design process.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>I'm resisting the urge to add new things to the web application, and instead I'm focusing on <strong>making the interface a little more intuitive</strong> - and generally tidying up some bits and pieces.</p>

<p>On Tuesday of next week <strong>I present the project to senior staff at Memorial Sloan-Kettering</strong> for feedback and discussion. I'll document what they have to say, and will try to implement any suggestions they have that can be done within the week. Anything that can't be done within the week will have to persist into a subsequent project or phase, or taken as a requirement/idea for work they do in the future.</p>
