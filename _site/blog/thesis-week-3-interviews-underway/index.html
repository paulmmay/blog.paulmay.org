		<p class="intro">I am just past the mid-point of the research phase of my thesis; this week was mostly spent interviewing staff at MSKCC. </p>


<p>As part of my thesis project, which I'm working on in colalboration with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, I'm conducting one month of desk and primary research - reading things, talking to people and observing. This week I completed five interviews with administrative and medical staff at MSKCC. The interviews are helping build a picture of the bone marrow transplantation process and the rehabilitation phase that follows. I've transcribed these interviews and have started to draw out key insights.</p>

<p>Next week, I'll complete my round of interviews and will spend some time doing observation exercises at the hospital. After that I get into concept development - then prototyping.</p>

<p>Time is flying, but I'm very happy with the work completed so far.&nbsp;</p>
