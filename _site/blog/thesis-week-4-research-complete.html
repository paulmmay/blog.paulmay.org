		<p class="intro">This week I completed the research phase of my thesis project; just a bit behind schedule. </p>
<p>This week marked the end of the 4-week long research phase of my thesis project. The research phase included background reading about bone marrow transplantation, and analysis of documentation and other materials available within MSKCC - patient interviews and design work done in the past.</p>

<p>When I felt that I had a good handle on the background to bone marrow transplantation, and knew enough to start asking stupid questions - I moved into some primary research; interviewing people who work in areas related to bone marrow transplantation (with a focus on rehabilitation and/or post-transplant care). All of these interviews have now been transcribed, and I’ve drawn out key pieces of information and quotes from the transcripts.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the research phase a lot; I met some really remarkable people and had the opportunity to reflect on my design process in a lot of detail. I’ve identified a couple of exciting, practical projects that I think flow naturally from the research findings - so now I just need to pick what sub-set of these challenges I want to focus on for the next few weeks and get building.</p>
