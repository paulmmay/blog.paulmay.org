<p class="intro">Last week I moved on from the research phase of my thesis project into a phase of concepting and prototyping. Here's a quick note on my progress. </p>


<p>In week 5 of my thesis I presented my progress and initial findings to the Innovation team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for feedback and discussion. During my research at the hospital I identified many opportunities to improve patients' experience through design, but two themes came through repeatedly; <strong>information</strong> and <strong>activity</strong>.</p>

<p>The first theme related to the the complexity and volume of information that patients and their families receive and understand during the bone marrow transplantation process. I saw how information offered to patients could seem overwhelming given their context, and I had some ideas as to how information could be delivered/experienced in a more natural way.</p>

<p>The second theme centred on patient's level of physical activity. During my interviews with them, doctors and therapists had stated the clinical benefits of exercise before, during and after a bone marrow transplant. The reasons for exercise change throughout the patient's journey, and the amount they need to do varies as well. In the patients' context where they experience periods of isolation and some debilitating symptoms, encouraging activity is not straightforward. I had some ideas about the design of a persuasive system to encourage activity in patients.</p>

<p>I've decided to <strong>pursue this second idea for the remainder of my thesis</strong>. I'll prototype a service that will encourage patients to remain physically active throughout their treatment in a way that is sensitive to their context. The service will also give their medical team some oversight, and will encourage them to play a role in motivating patients. Most of the key parts of this service will be non-technical - they'll be tools/guides that will help to guide different members of the clinical team as to their role in deliver the service. Having said that I will build a web application of some kind to help act as a hub for the service. This project dovetails nicely with the work I did last semester on the design of persuasive health applications in my DIY Health class with Steven Dean.</p>

<p>I have written more detailed documentation around this concept; a project mandate, some constraints and design principles. This documentation will be my guide in the next four weeks of prototyping. I'll also continue to work closely with the staff at MSKCC, and I'll have a more formal checkpoint with them in late March.</p>

<p>In the next two weeks I'll interview some patients who are currently undergoing treatment and these interviews will focus specifically on the challenges around physical activity. I'll then complete a simple sketch/prototype of the service and gather some feedback.</p>

<p>So, things are going to some sort of plan. I hope you're well.</p>
