<p class="intro">A so-so week of prototyping and noodling, sneezing and spluttering.</p>


<p>I spent the start of the week getting back up to speed after a weekend in Chicago seeing my brother and his wife, Amy. That trip was a much needed break, but when I got home I realised that I was getting sick, and the rest of the week kind of went downhill from there. It's just a cold, but it has kind of knocked the stuffing out of me. I managed to make some progress on the project, which is good - but certainly not a week where what I have now looks significantly better than what I had last week.</p>

<p>Aside from being sick this week, I also started to feel a bit jaded by the grind of the solo, semester-long project. Working on solo projects is usually right up my street, but I've been too distant from my friends at ITP, and this has added to the normal challenges of working alone. At the half-way point of the semester I have time to adjust and re-connect; I just need to make sure that I do.</p>

<p>A tricky week.</p>
