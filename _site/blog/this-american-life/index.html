		<p>It's cooler here now, the 90 degree heat of the last few days has given way to a cloudy, comfortable 80. The dew-point has dropped according to the weather forecaster...whatever that means. Anyway, that's your Chicago weather report.</p>

<p>Applying for jobs in the US is a funny exercise. Every person who hands me a job application to fill in seems singularly enthusiastic to see me; like I'm the one they've been waiting for all these years. Every shop, every bar, every restaurant and temp agency. I am the one, hot shit. I have come to take the clouds and the doubt away; to carry that tray into table-waiting history</p>

<p>They don't call though. That's another thing about applying for jobs here; they don't call you to let you know you didn't get it, they don't even respond to phone messages or e-mails. Oh well, I suppose I can live with that...rejection phone calls aren't exactly roller-coaster rides of amusement; but at least I'd have that closure, and at the very least that guy at the one hour photo booth wouldn't have to tell me that the manager is on a call for the 18th time. I just want to hear those words: "The position has been filled, but we'll keep your résumé on file". Sweet relief for the troubled job-hunting soul.</p>

<p>It's weird to be having such a great time while at the same time having no money and no job. I'd say I have a couple of weeks left before I'll have to make some serious decisions; change location, borrow money, move back to Ireland. I don't really want to consider any of those options right now, but they're always at the back of my mind. I talked to Derek in San Francisco, and things on the west coast are about the same; lots of fun, with the clock ticking in the background.</p>

<p>Tick tock.</p>
