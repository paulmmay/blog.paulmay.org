<h3 id="patsy-lagan-kicks-ass">Patsy Lagan Kicks Ass</h3>
<p>We had a fantastic time at TriAthy at the weekend. Unfortunately I wasn’t in good enough shape to do the race, but went along to cheer on my Front colleague Patsy Lagan who was taking part. She kicked ass, and had a great time doing her first triathlon.</p>

<h3 id="bigger-amp-better">Bigger &amp; Better</h3>
<p>What can you say about TriAthlone? <strong>It gets bigger and better each year</strong>. The race is immaculately organised - it’s fun and safe for spectators, and from what I could see, a great experience for competitors. This year the race featured a new swim layout (the swim has been hellish in recent years, as the current at Athlone is incredibly strong) and a new transition area within Athlone barracks.</p>

<p>I couldn’t tell how many people were taking part, but it seemed like thousands. <strong>The whole town had basically been given over to what was, up until recently, an obscure sport in Ireland.</strong> I know this is passé but triathlon’s growth just surprises and delights me with every race I see or compete in.</p>

<p>I’m going to make Triathlone 2010 a key target race, most definitely; it’s unfortunate that I didn’t get to take part in such a great day. <strong>Next year Athlone, next year.</strong></p>
