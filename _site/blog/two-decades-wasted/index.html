<p>What I find most disappointing about the recent statements from <a href="http://www.nni.ie/v2/broad/portal.php?content=../_includes/prportal.php&date=4th%20Jan%202013&year=2013">National Newspapers of Ireland</a> isn't that they assert that linking to a website could require licensing - that old chestnut is as old as the web itself. What is most disappointing is that it's a clear sign that the Irish news media have done very little to prepare for the opportunities that the web now offers them.</p>

<p>What we've seen in the last few weeks from NNI is old thinking -  an entrenched mindset that can't consider the value of content unbundled from a physical medium or an insular website. If hyperlinks are beyond the Irish news media's ken, what about complex economic issues, data-driven journalism, mobile computing, video journalism, blogging?</p>

<p>I contend that two decades is adequate time for any industry to hone the critical faculties, business models and skills made relevant by new technologies. Similarly, if you're a journalist and your skillset hasn't expanded to include an understanding of copyright, mass-participation in media production, ethics in the digital age, data analysis and online publishing then your window of relevance is probably going to be limited.</p>

<p>Let the newspapers that NNI represents keep pace with Irish people and contemporary society or let them die. No more holding back the seas.</p>
