<p>New York City has issued a design challenge called <a href="http://www.reinventpayphones.splashthat.com/">Reinvent Payphones</a> and has asked designers to think of new uses for the city's payphone infrastructure. I attended the information session last night and was really disheartened by the approach being taken by the City. In my opinion, the <a href="http://www.reinventpayphones.splashthat.com/#rules_nav">terms of the challenge</a> are cynical and unfair.</p>

<p>Designers will receive no compensation for their time or materials. They automatically give the city a free, perptetual license to use their work. A "completely separate", commercial procurement process for the actual development of a new payphone system will be run separately. But, while this process is separate, designers' ideas might be incorporated into that process.</p>

<p>Essentially Reinvent Payphones boils down to the City using the design community to flesh out the requirements of a highly lucrative, commerical contract - in return for some praise and publicity.</p>

<p>I am just not comfortable with uncompensated design challenges like Reinvent Payphones, especially when the terms are so out of balance. Here are just a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Uncompensated design challenges are exploitative. When a company or organization with the wherewithal to offer compensation asks a designer to solve a problem and then give the solution to them for free, that is exploitative. Just because the organization arranges for the person to be praised in public for being such a good sport is irrelevant. Publicity is gratifying but it doesn't put food on the table.</li>
<li>Uncompensated design challenges reward the wrong thing. Is the design that gains the widest publicity the best design? Of course not. It's just the one optimized for maximum public acceptance.</li>
<li>Uncompensated design challenges are elitist. Uncompensated design challenges exclude people who have the most to gain from good design from the design process. The underserved and disadvantaged can't gamble their time on the promise of good vibes the possibility of a paying job down the road.</li>
</ol>


<p>If we take these few problems and run them over time, what do we get? We get a lot of designers doing work but only some living with dignity. We get a class of "successful" designers who live apart from the people who really need the products of good design. We get a design culture where people who shape reputations hold far more power than the people we design for. We optimise for designs that are "right" because they find favour.</p>

<p>I think we can do better than this. I'd love to hear your thoughts on uncompensated design challenges, and ways of encouraging participation and collaboration without exploitation.</p>
