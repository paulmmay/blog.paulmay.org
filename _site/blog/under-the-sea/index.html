<p>Dublin swelters in much welcome, and probably short-lived spell of hot weather. On Friday I had a night out with work, and with the crazy, naive optimism that good weather brings, we decided to swim in the sea at 9am on Saturday morning. I struggled to Seapoint for 9, but the tide was way way out (something you’d think we’d have checked) so we moved on to the 40 foot, where there was plenty of water - and also plenty of jellyfish.</p>

<p>As we swam there were little white jellyfish, big white jellyfish - glowing, moving quietly in the newly warmed water. Ed thought he saw a seal, and then he was sure he saw a seal - because he was swimming around our legs, bumping Ed’s legs (according to one of the locals “they like the wetsuits” [great]). The seal was huge and graceful, and kindly decided not to bite lumps out of us. It was a good morning of swimming - not for distance, but just for the fact that we were in pretty deep water and I got to wipe the slate clean after Athlone.</p>

<p>The rest of the weekend was similarly warm, so I did some cycling from point A to B, but no super long cycles. (Congratulations to Ed who is now the proud owner of a shiny new Trek 1000 bike). This morning I swam at the ungodly hour of 6am, but it felt great and I did 1200m; I have my usual Piranha swim tomorrow. I also need a haircut.</p>
