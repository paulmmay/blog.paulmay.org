<p class="intro">We are collaborating with UNICEF to design new and better ways for them to cope with disasters. This week we've been asked to sketch out some early ideas. I was interested in the problems associated with staff turnover and their capacity to reduce UNICEF's effectiveness.

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>In the aftermath of a disaster UNICEF send expert staff to the affected area; these people spend <strong>a short, intense period of time applying their skills and expertise to save lives</strong> and help with recovery. The work involves <strong>very long hours in a stressful, complex and emotionally charged context</strong>. After a period of about 6 weeks, <strong>a staff member will leave the disaster area</strong>, and a person with similar skills will arrive to replace them - a rotation designed to avoid complete burnout.</p>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>A considerable amount of contextual and practical information is lost in this rotation - friction that the incoming team member has to overcome. <strong>What can we do to reduce the negative effects/friction likely to occur when </strong>person A leaves the disaster area<strong> and </strong>person B arrives to take up their role<strong>? How do we ensure that this transition does not impact on the quality of UNICEF's response to the disaster?</strong> For the sake of this discussion I'm going to call Person A (the person leaving the disaster scene) <strong>Alice</strong> and Person B (the person arriving at the disaster scene) <strong>Fred</strong>.</p>

<h3>Considerations &amp; Constraints</h3>

<p>Based on the limited information we have been given by UNICEF, these constraints seem to apply to the scenario:</p>

<ol>
* When in a disaster situation Alice's immediate priorities are the health and well-being of people.
* The day to day context in which Alice works is often unpredictable; depending on the immediate needs of people.
* What little time Alice has away from the scene of the disaster is spent resting/recovering, sleeping.
* There is obviously limited scope to reduce the amount of rest time Alice gets; i.e. by adding additional duties.
* It's highly likely that Alice and Fred will never have the opportunity to meet up in person.
</ol>


<p>I think we should work to accommodate these constraints by:</p>

<ol>
* Ensuring Alice can spend the same amount of time helping people affected by the disaster; we can't remove her from this context to prepare notes or handover materials.
* Building a solution that expects Alice's surroundings to change; we can't rely on systems and tools that don't adapt to context
* Avoiding batching up work for Alice to do at the end of the day; that wouldn't be fair
* Minimising effort involved in Alice contributing information; make the system as passive/autonomic as possible.
* Encapsulating the information and passing it to Fred in a manageable chunk - without Alice's involvement.
</ol>


<h3>Sketched Idea - Something to Try</h3>

<p>I want to create a system that allows Alice to package up what she thinks is important information, on her own terms and on her own time - the output of which is a body of information that can be consumed by Fred. I think it's reasonable to expect that Fred is likely to be under severe time pressure as soon as he gets to the disaster area; so I think the goal should be to create information he can be consumed on-demand, while on the move and in a short period of time.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/5018609797/" title="Simple Audio Recorder by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5018609797_915566ce7a_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="Simple Audio Recorder" /></a><br />
Here is one approach that could be taken to create useful, accessible handover content;</p>

<ul>
<li>Purchase a small, cheap, solid-state audio recorder and assign it to each role that will live beyond one generation (a role that will have rotating personnel).</li>
<li>Place the audio recorder in a bin labeled with the name of the role at UNICEF's base.</li>
<li>Direct the person to pick up the audio recorder when they arrive in the area.</li>
<li>Include some fresh batteries.</li>
</ul>


<p>Along with the recorder, include a note:</p>

<blockquote>Carry this audio recorder with you. At least once per day turn it on - press record, and say where you are. Talk about anything important you have done since you last made a recording, talk about the people who helped you, talk about the people who got in your way. Before you leave, place the recorder back where you found it. Your recordings will be heard by Fred who is 42 and from Denver.
</blockquote>


<p>(If this person is not the first to inhabit the role, you'd obviously want to prompt them to listen back to the contents of the recorder.)</p>

<h3>Ideal Outcome</h3>

<p>The ideal outcome is that Alice takes the recorder and uses it as she goes about her work in the field. She records between 1 - 3 minutes of audio per day, some of which offers practical insight into problems she sees on the ground and her approach to solving them. Crucially, her recordings offer a list of people who have enabled her to do her job effectively and those who got in the way.</p>

<p>When Fred arrives he picks up the audio recorder, listens back to the content and <strong>gets a sense of where (geographically) problems have arisen, and who he needs to work with to get things done</strong>. On day one he is already aware of crucial, experiential information - making him more effective at his job, and improving UNICEF's response to the disaster.</p>

<h3>Why This is Worth Trying</h3>

<p>This is worth trying because <strong>the amount of information currently being passed from Alice to Fred is very low</strong>; anything would be an improvement. Because Alice knows basic details about Fred, she is more likely to want to help - rather than asking her to contribute to a vague information-gathering initiative.</p>

<p>The system is <strong>cheap</strong> to trial - involving low-cost, off the shelf hardware, some batteries and some paper. It <strong>can be trialed with a small number of people</strong>, and affords making improvements as you learn from each handover.</p>

<p>The device is mobile and can be <strong>used in whatever context Alice sees fit</strong>.</p>

<p>A successful handover from Alice to Fred creates <strong>a positive feedback loop</strong>; improving the quality of Fred's work, encouraging him to pass on valuable information to the person who replaces him. The system also offers potential to aggregate information, learn from it, and improve future responses to disasters.</p>

<h3>Why This Isn't Worth Trying</h3>

<p>This isn't worth trying because<strong> there's no way to get it off to a good start</strong>. Alice won't have been the receiver of information from previous generations, and so <strong>won't see value in adopting it</strong>. She won't give it her time; so <strong>a feedback loop can never start</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The system still presents a lot of friction</strong> - it asks Alice to spend time doing something that doesn't immediately help herself or others. <strong>There's no point in her spending time on something that might be useful for Fred in the future</strong> when there are things that she can do to be useful now.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I think there is a germ of an idea here that starts to get at a problem; obviously I'd like to now spend more time with UNICEF to dig deeper into their own first-hand experiences of disaster response.</p>

<p>If there turns out to be something of value here I'd like to create a more engaging storyboard/treatment to see if I'm missing anything obvious, and to illicit as much feedback as possible.
