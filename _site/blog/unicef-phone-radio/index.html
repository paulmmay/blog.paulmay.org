<p class="intro">This week we were challenged to identify three ways in which UNICEF could help those affected by a sudden disaster using a Nokia 1100 phone and an AM/FM radio.</p>


<h3>The Team</h3>

<p>This week I had the pleasure of working with <a href="http://www.sajanr.com/" title="Sajan">Sajan</a>, <a href="http://kimispencer.com/" title="Kimi">Kimi</a> and Guang - super talented folks.</p>

<h3>Our Process</h3>

<p>We started by working through a standard brainstorming process:</p>

<ul>
<li>We articulated what we had been asked to do as specifically as we could - we were being asked to help the response to a disaster using a simple mobile phone and a radio as the primary tools</li>
<li>We individually wrote down words, thoughts, ideas, that came to mind based on the brief and the scenarios UNICEF have described to us - trying to generate as many things as possible to discuss.</li>
<li>These broad ideas were written up on a board, and each person talked through what they were thinking about - explaining their ideas.</li>
<li>We loosely refined the definitions of the ideas, just so we were all clear what each thing meant; sometimes building-up or changing ideas as we explained them</li>
<li>Once we were all clear on what each idea represented, we individually circled the three ideas we thought had  most promise</li>
<li>At this point we broke off individually to write elevator pitches for each of the three ideas; matching the needs we thought would be present in the disaster zone to the attributes of our services/offerings.</li>
</ul>


<p>Once we had written and discussed the elevator pitches it became pretty clear that in the case of one idea, we would have been applying the constraints of the phone and radio with no real reason - it would have been a square peg in a round hold. We decided to leave this idea behind. We still had our original palette of ideas, so we dipped back into it - taking, then developing the next most promising idea.</p>

<p>So, after just over an hour of discussion we had three ideas to write up and present to UNICEF. These ideas are sketched out below.</p>

<h3>Bedtime Stories</h3>

<p>In disaster situations it's important that children still have an opportunity to imagine, dream, feel comforted, sleep - to be children. Bedtime Stories is a nightly, one hour radio programme of bedtime stories for children.</p>

<p><strong>How does it work?:</strong> Each day children and their parents call and text in ideas for stories, or with responses to questions posed by the Bedtime Stories team; e.g. what is your favourite animal, what do you dream about? The Bedtime Stories team take these ideas and use them to create three, original, twenty-minute stories for the next day's broadcast.</p>

<p><strong>We like this idea because:</strong> Bedtime Stories just feels right to us; it's gentle. We like the idea of there being a safe, shared narrative - something that children experience together in the middle of obvious upset. We also wanted to give them the opportunity to contribute their own thoughts and ideas into the creation of the stories - we thought this would be fun and empowering, but that it would also allow the writers to address common themes (fears, hopes) being expressed by children, maybe helping to ease trauma in some way.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Children and families need only to have access to a radio to hear the stories, and if they want to contribute ideas they just need a phone and a phone number.&nbsp; The production team need to be able to write and tell compelling stories; not an easy task. On the technical production side, the Bedtime Stories team need to be able to take suggestions via voice-call or text and to broadcast an AM/FM signal. Recording ability would be optional, as stories could be performed live.</p>

<h3>Mobile Bazaar</h3>

<p>In disaster situations it's important that resources (materials, food, clothing, medicine, skills) are made available where they are needed the most. Mobile Bazaar is a resource and skill sharing system; a way to connect people who have something to the people who need it.</p>

<p><strong>How does it work?:</strong> People call or text in details of the skill or item that they have or need, and they are matched against other people - with details of the other person given back to them on the phone or via SMS. Mobile Bazaar also has a daily, one hour radio programme as a focal point. The radio programme encourages people to phone in with details of something they have or need, so that they can be matched with other callers live on air.</p>

<p><strong>We like this idea because:</strong> We thought of this service as a practical, efficient way for communities to help each other through a difficult situation - as a resource sharing tool. We also thought of it as a way of empowering and connecting people, offering a sense of hope and empowerment that is not given from the outside (from an agency or government), but is generated through voluntary action.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> This idea has similar requirements to Bedtime Stories; users need a phone and a radio to participate fully as users. The production team need to be able to field a volume of calls, produce and broadcast a radio programme.</p>

<h3>My Radio Show</h3>

<p>In disaster situations people need to have fun and get things off their chest. My Radio is a daily radio programme which allows people to request any song they like, say anything they like, express anything they like to whoever is listening at the time.</p>

<p><strong>How does it work?: </strong> This ideas is incredibly simple; it's just a talk radio show designed to give people a bit of power over the music they want to hear, and to give them a voice. People call or text in song requests, thoughts, opinions, frustrations - and these are broadcast out.</p>

<p><strong>We like this idea because:</strong> This isn't an idea we needed to think about in huge detail; it's a simple idea that focuses on entertainment and self-expression, rather on anything too profound. We thought that if we were in a difficult situation, we would really value something that offered good music and a connection to other people in our community.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements: </strong> Users can listen if they have a radio, and participate more fully if they have the ability to call or text the programme. The production team need to be able to field calls and texts, and should have access to a library of music - probably through an online music-download service.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>The next step, as usual, it to present these ideas to our classmates and the UNICEF team for feedback and discussion - I am excited to see what the rest of the class came up with in response to this brief.</p>
