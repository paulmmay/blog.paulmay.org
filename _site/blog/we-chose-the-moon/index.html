<p>50 years ago today John F. Kennedy made a speech at Rice University committing the United States to a manned landing on the moon. At the time of the speech airplanes were about 60 years old and only 5 years before the first artificial satellite was put into orbit. Now it was apparently time to send humans to the moon - not to solve a problem, but because it might be possible. Here's my favourite part of the speech:</p>

<blockquote>Despite the striking fact that most of the scientists that the world has ever known are alive and working today, despite the fact that this Nation's own scientific manpower is doubling every 12 years in a rate of growth more than three times that of our population as a whole, despite that, the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension.</blockquote>

<p>The audacity of it makes my head swim; the skills, infrastructures and technologies to do what Kennedy was proposing simply didn't exist. What did exist was an opponent, fear of nuclear annihilation at the hands of that opponent and limitless resources. The success of the moon landing was a measure of what human ingenuity and effort could achieve in a particularly scary geopolitical context.</p>

<p>It would be nice to think that humans are still capable of crazy schemes like this, maybe even without the need for the world to be divided in half. Maybe we just need to choose to go to Mars, and figure the rest out later.</p>
