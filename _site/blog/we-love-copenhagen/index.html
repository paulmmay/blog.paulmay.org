<p class="intro">Last week we paid a surprise visit to see <a href="http://www.kevin.ie">Kevin Cannon</a> in Copenhagen; Kevin has been studying at the <a href="http://ciid.dk/">Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design</a>, and by all accounts has been kicking ass. We got to see the CIID end of year show and spend some time in this wonderful city.</p>


<h3>Surprising Kevin</h3>

<p>Sarah, Kevin's lovely girlfriend, invited us over to see Kev as a nice surprise. Kevin has been <strong>busting his ass at CIID for the last year</strong>, so the plan was to go to see him, catch the CIID end of year show and basically let rip for the weekend. It worked out perfectly; he had no clue we were coming - Ciar&aacute;n even called him &#8220;from Dublin&#8221; as we were arriving to chat about some freelance work. When we got to the exhibition he had disappeared somewhere; and got a bit suspicious when we asked him where &#8220;exactly he was&#8221;. We found him and some champagne ensued - it was lovely.

<h3>CIID</h3>

<p>I couldn't talk about the weekend without talking about the <strong>CIID end of year show</strong> - which was inspiring. There is clearly <a title="CIID on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/904149@N24/">a wealth of talent coming through the course</a>, so hopefully CIID will be around for years to come - I know that funding this type of programme is very challenging.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/3901790682/" title="Introverted Lamp by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3102/3901790682_c76fbecf07.jpg" class="photo" alt="Introverted Lamp" /></a>My favourite project on display was the <strong>Synthesising Personality</strong> project by <a href="http://tobiastoft.dk/">Tobias Toft</a>. Tobias built everyday objects that exhibit personality traits; an introverted lamp that moves away as you approach, a neurotic computer, a psychotic plant. It's amazing how, with subtle movement or reaction to stimuli, you were able to recognise &#8220;human&#8221; behavioural traits in inanimate objects. <strong>It was a lovely, pure idea implemented to a very high standard</strong>. Other projects included Kevin's <em>lovely</em> interactive storytelling project  <strong>Remember Dreaming</strong> and <strong><a href="http://tthheessiiss.wordpress.com/">Cheap, Fat</a> and <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/08/arduino_synth_cheap_fat_open.html">Open</a></strong> - an open-source platform for musical experimentation (which we jammed on for a good 20 minutes).</p>

<h3>A Cyclist's City</h3>

<p>The weekend contained a fair share of drunken cycling - Kevin and Sarah had kindly arranged some bikes for us to use to get around the city.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/3900988155/" title="Brooks Saddle by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img class="photo" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3437/3900988155_99f2576770.jpg" alt="Brooks Saddle" /></a><strong>In Copenhagen, everybody cycles; parents, children, old and young</strong>.&nbsp; Bicycles aren't a commodity and there are few enough &#8220;cool bikes&#8221; - <strong>most are mildly rusty, well loved, functional workhorses</strong>. Cycling in Copenhagen is deliciously normal.
Copenhagen is a model of how cycling can work in a major city where population density/housing allows most journeys to be taken by bicycle. The city basically has <strong>an alternative roads system for bikes</strong>; a third lane on most major roads set aside for bikes. It was a lot of fun to jump on our bikes as a group and head out around the city and feel safe and separate from most traffic. <strong>There's no reason why Dublin people couldn't move towards this type of model over the next generation </strong>(although we may have missed the boat somewhat with the terrible planning decisions made in the last decade). Hey, we can always dream.</p>

<h3>Other Highlights</h3>

<p>It's late, and I'm a bit shattered - so <strong>a quick summary of the rest of the weekend's highlights</strong>: an amazing (and cheap!) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/3901156943/in/set-72157622313135352/">boat tour around Copenhagen</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/3901786542/in/set-72157622313135352/">coffee and sticky cakes</a> by the lake, a wander around the weird and wonderful Christiania, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/3906902085/in/set-72157622313135352/">made up billiards games in the pub</a>, cooking breakfast for people in the mornings, even more drunk cycling, and sweaty dancing the night away.</p>

<p>Go to Copenhagen - it's brillo. Kev and Sarah - thanks for a great few days.</p>
