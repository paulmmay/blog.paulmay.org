<h1>Simple Shapes in Processing</h1>  
    <p class="intro">My first experiment with Processing. Draw a simple two-dimensional shape. I've chosen to draw a chess board, or checkered pattern.</p>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>I installed the Processing environment and got up and running pretty quickly; the only thing that I tweaked was to point to a sketches folder in my Dropbox, so that when I save a sketch it'll be uploaded to into the ether-cloud for safe keeping. I will probably end up using some sort of source control, but this will do for now.</p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>

<p>I want to draw a chess board pattern in Processing using the rect(); function we were shown today, and I also want to see how processing uses loops and conditionals; for and if.</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>

<p>This little exercise turned out to be a bit tricky actually. I ended up using some loops and inner loops to step through drawing rectangles horizontally and vertically - with two loops to see if the row was odd or even to start with either a rectangle filled with white or black. I am sure that there is a very, very simple way of doing this with a 2D array (or just better code in general), but I am more than a bit programming rusty. Anyway, I got there in the end.</p>

<h3>Final Sketch &amp; Source</h3>

<p>The applet is acting weird across different browsers - I'm not sure why. In the meantime here is a non-troublesome image of the sketch, and you can <a href="http://paulmay.org/images/uploads/sketch_sep08b_chessboard_3.pde" title="download the source">download the source</a> or <a href="http://paulmay.org/images/uploads/sketch_sep08b_chessboard_3.jar" title="the jar">the jar</a> to run this yourself.
