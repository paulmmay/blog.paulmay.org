<p>Hello. My back injury is persisting, so I have a doctor's visit tomorrow and physiotherapy on Thursday. My gut feeling (or back feeling as it were) is that I'll need an orthotic for my left shoe (or both) and some more weeks of physio. It's worrying me a lot because it's painful to walk, let alone run at the moment. Thankfully my swimming and cycling appear to be unaffected, it's the impact of walking and running that is really uncomfortable (and a low generalised pain pretty much all the time). Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>In other news I spent a lovely weekend in Galway. The hotel had a very nice pool which I used to do some drills and laps; nothing too strenuous. My body position in the water is still terrible, but I obviously haven't been able to tell while swimming. <a href="http://swimming.about.com/cs/techniquetips/a/headpoint.htm" target="_top">This page</a> has some good tips which I'll follow in my next session.</p>
