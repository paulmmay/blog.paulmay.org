<p class="intro"></p>


<p>I had a great long weekend in Longford and here, and I managed to put in a few hours training as well. On Saturday I did 4.5K on the roads in Longford, and the same again on Sunday. The route was very hilly, so I found myself reaching my maximum heart rate very quickly, and then slowing down - sometimes stopping when my rate spiked over my maximum. After the two days of running I found that my left foot was incredibly sore; so I may need to work on the way I'm transferring weight onto my left side (I felt it in my back too). I've decided to lay off the running until the weekend, work on my swimming, and then see how my foot feels at the weekend.</p>

<p>Swimming today was good - I got there early to warm up and did drills and swam well for 90 minutes without cramping up too much. The technique is very hard to work on when I'm running out of breath and my arms are falling off, but hopefully it'll come eventually.</p>

<p>I've been neglecting the bike - must do something about that this week.</p>
