		<p>We're back in Oxford this week after two weeks in Ireland for Christmas. Things are going well.</p>

<p>I bought myself a little bike to run around Oxford, and this has made getting to and from the gym and pool much easier. I'm back into an exercise routine, and while starting again with swimming is always tough after a long break, I'm happy to be back moving again.</p>

<p>For the last year I've been scraping together a dataset from news sources in Ireland. This week I've started to pull the data together, and think about projects I'd like to pursue to explore the data. Nothing revolutionary, just some visual and textual analysis of news and published sentiment over the last 12 months; maybe some things similar to my From Over Here project. It's exciting to have a home-made dataset, rich enough to address from a number of different angles.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about the purpose of a blog/personal site is in 2014, and I have arrived at an answer that lives somewhere between lab notebook (demonstrating work done in pursuit of some experiment or other), LEGO box (lots of tiny, pre-made components that can be re-fashioned into different forms), and a sort of public workspace or shop (A place where I am sitting at a bench making something, can gesture to others to look, contribute to others' work - the Shop at ITP basically).</p>

<p>As part of this exploration and thought-process, I've started to compile a lot of the data that's out there in my social networks into my own API, making it much easier for me to incorporate things like tweets, bookmarks, photos and other breadcrumbs I leave around the web into this site and other projects. Once I've gathered enough data, I'll dig into making endpoints, components etc.</p>

<p>Work is going well. I will be in New York w/c 20th to meet up with the folks from Sloan-Kettering. I'm looking forward to the trip.</p>

<p>That's all for now.</p>
