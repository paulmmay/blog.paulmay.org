<p class="intro">Earlier this year I had the pleasure of spending a few hours with the folks at Pixar; in the run up to the release of Toy Story 3 I thought I'd jot down a few thoughts on my visit. Short version: Pixar are awesome.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/4410971850/" title="Pixar by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4055/4410971850_c389e619cf_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="The wonderful atrium at Pixar; a huge, open space that greets you as you enter the building. It's like an incredibly classy shopping centre (mall)"></a><br />
In March I spent a wonderful week in the Bay Area meeting with creative and innovative companies; field-trip as part of the excellent <a href="http://www.trcmedia.org/" title="Cross Creative">Cross Creative</a> programme. One of those companies, Pixar, needs no introduction - they have been responsible for some of the most successful, emotional, evocative and beautiful films of the past two decades and it was <em>very, very exciting</em> to have a chance to visit them.</p>

<h3>Enabling Creative Teams</h3>

<p>At Pixar we met with <a href="http://twitter.com/drwave" title="Dr. Michael B. Johnson">Dr. Michael B. Johnson</a>, who runs the Moving Pictures Group; the team responsible for building the core tools used by directors, writers and artists to take an idea from inception up to the point where 3D animation begins.</p>

<p>The Moving Pictures Group's work is a big deal; each project brings together a team of people, a diverse set of tools and thousands (<em>many</em> thousands) of physical and digital assets; the Moving Pictures Group build and support the software to bring these things together to &#8220;allow creative people to be creative, then leave them alone&#8221; as Michael B. Johnson put it.</p>

<p>The company's project management tools, storyboarding tools and asset management tools are all <strong>created in-house based on continuous feedback from creative teams</strong>. These tools are designed to offer a smooth, integrated experience; reducing waste and cost. Reducing waste is as important to Pixar as it is to any company trying to compete in a competitive market.</p>

<p>Contrast this approach with the approach of many animation studios where a huge amount of work is outsourced to mange costs; <strong>Pixar don't outsource any part of their process</strong>.</p>

<h3>Being Amazing Takes Time</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.pixar.com/howwedoit/">Pixar website</a> does a pretty good job of outlining the company's creative process; but essentially <strong>everything begins with one person</strong> (usually a director) - whose core job is to formulate, explore and develop a great story. Once a story has been pitched and shaped somewhat the director will usually be joined by an art director to explore visual ideas, and then this little team will scale up to 8-10 people as the story is refined and storyboarded. The team builds and builds until it's in production - when hundreds of people will contribute to the final film.</p>

<p>This all sounds quite mechanical, but <strong>typically a project will spend 2-3 years in pre-production; moving from concept through exploration and into a script, storyboards</strong>; exploration is meticulous. For example, directors will <strong>build or commission prototypes of characters, props and sets</strong> - sometimes asking their favourite artists to explore ideas in two and three dimensions - because just drawing something on paper doesn't offer a clear sense of movement and physicality.</p>

<p>We were fortunate enough to see (but not photograph) a jaw-dropping array of exploration work; my favourite was a blown up version of <a href="http://louromano.blogspot.com/2009/05/art-of-up_3697.html" title="Lou Romano's colour script for the film Up">Lou Romano's colour script for the film Up</a>; the colour script allows the director to plot mood, colour and shape across key scenes of a film.</p>

<p>This type of exploration isn't unique to Pixar; many other animation companies carry out similar activities as they explore the development of stories - but as with all the other things Pixar do, the quality of the company's exploration is second to none; <strong>the exploration is as thorough, careful and crafted as the films themselves</strong>.</p>

<h3>Summing Up</h3>

<p>It was an inspiring few hours at Pixar, and in a way I'm glad it's taken me this long to sit down and reflect on the experience. At this distance, it is pretty clear to me that the success of Pixar's films hinges on a few simple-to-understand but probably-impossible-to-emulate factors:</p>

<ol>* Deeply and honestly felt **passion** for storytelling and great ideas.
* A willingness to **take time, care and attention** to explore and refine stories and ideas - there is no shortcut to the goal of an amazing Pixar film.
* Amazingly talented people - not just talented people - **the best people** working in film-making today.
* Continuous focus on **smoothing out friction** in the creative process - reducing waste and unnecessary costs.</ol>


<p>So; easy-peasy. Let's all put the kettle on, dream, explore, iterate and learn. (p.s. I want to work for Pixar)</p>
