<p class="intro">Summer has been moving along nicely; my work at Frog is going well and I've started to turn my thoughts to the coming year at ITP. In this quick sketch I talk about something close to my heart; the process of design. </p>


<p>After a year of experimentation, working with great new people, I more confident than ever that a solid design <em>process</em> is valuable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I talk about the process of design I mean that it is good to approach concepts or problems with a basic toolkit; understanding how to apply a couple of research activities, knowing how to work on a team, finding the right material or tool to use after many years of experimentation.</p>

<p>In year one of ITP I had the opportunity to expand my toolkit, taking approaches I had used to make things for the web, modifying them to make devices, representations of data, audio pieces, essays and lots of other stuff.&nbsp; I was able to get back in touch with skills that I had let wither, like programming, sketching, electronics, drawing and creative writing. Having a very loose toolkit expanded my ability to get to grips with what was special about each project - it basically allowed me to cope with what was sometimes an intense workload while still doing some good work.</p>

<p>On the less positive side, I also now know that my way of doing things closed me off from ideas and opportunities that I should have considered or pursued further. In the coming year I need to make sure that I am really going out of my way to question how I work, and going out of my way to consider other viewpoints and approaches to projects.</p>

<p>So, that's item number one for year two at ITP; recognition that each project is actually two projects; the one that delivers an outcome, and the one that expands my capabilities and ways of thinking.</p>
