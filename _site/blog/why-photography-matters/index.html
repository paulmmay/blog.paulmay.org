<p class="intro">A few thoughts after a difficult week.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/2952355880/" title="Dressing Room by paulmmay, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3253/2952355880_566f19fdc8_z.jpg" class="photo" alt="Dressing Room" /></a><br />
For me, photography is the celebration of a moment.</p>

<p>Photography is the ability to pause time and to see the world in an unexpected way; to control that moment - to exclude, to frame, to move closer or further away so that the image is a vessel for the way I feel about that moment, not just a poor imitation of the experience. Photography gives me a way to mark a point in time, where the photograph is a starting point for a story or a reflection - these stories change as does my relationship to the moment in the photograph; sometimes it's nice to look, and sometimes it isn't.</p>

<p>The camera is just the tool I use to achieve these outcomes - imperfectly. The camera is like a child's hands cupped around a bumble-bee; a way to hold something unpredictable in the dark before letting it go free so it can be useful. It is recursive, it facilitates the ability to get better at its own use - but is otherwise meaningless in the exchange between the moment and the photographer; a useful constraint against which technical progress can be measured.&nbsp; Sometimes the camera is an obstacle, it's a negative, it's a barrier between me and an experience - but I am in control of the camera and I can always put it down, leave it at home.</p>

<p>Photography is not my cameras. Photography is what I do, what I love, and how far I've come - so to the person who broke into our apartment this week - taking practically all my photography equipment; you are an annoyance, an interruption, but in reality you haven't taken a damn thing.</p>
