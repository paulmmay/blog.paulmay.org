		<p class="intro">I am heading into my third week of year 2 at ITP, so it feels like a good time to stop, take a look around and talk about what's next.</p>


<p>I am taking five classes this semester on a diverse set of topics, from art history to health device design. My goal was to take classes that push me somewhat out of my comfort zone into more conceptual territory, while also giving me scope to make things. Here's a quick summary of what I've been doing in each class, and what's coming up.</p>

<h3>The Pattern in the Noise</h3>

<p>The Pattern in the Noise: Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis with R is a seven week class taught by Jake Porway. The goal of the class is to teach us some fundamental skills related to the analysis of large data sets using the stats package R. I wanted to take this class because it'll help me accomplish more with my work in data visualisation - I just want to be a little more confident in my ability to identify and draw out meaning from data sets, while treating source data properly/ethically (i.e. not pointing to things unless they are significant beyond reasonable doubt, or connecting things that aren't connected).</p>

<p>The next steps in this class are to become more comfortable with R by manipulating sample sets of data, before moving on to look at our own data.</p>

<h3>DIY Health</h3>

<p>In <strong>DIY Health</strong>, taught be Steven Dean, we are designing tools to help people gather information about the current state of their health, set goals, encourage action and monitor progress. Instead of working to improve existing health infrastructure (better hospitals, better medical devices), we're trying to intervene in people's day to day lives, using smart devices to encourage healthy lifestyles. The eventual outcome of this project will be speculative designs or prototypes of new services/devices that we believe will have positive effects for people.</p>

<p>The <strong>next steps</strong> in this class are look closely at <strong>behaviour and motivation</strong> as they relate to health/lifestyle, before looking at ways to design positive feedback loops that help to encourage healthy lifestyles. I will probably try to integrate some of my experience training for triathlon into this class as well.</p>

<h3>Recurring Concepts in Art</h3>

<p>This class takes me out of my comfort zone! In this class, which is taught by Georgia Krantz, I'll be looking at the history of major movements in modern and contemporary art. Each week we read and investigate a theme; like the use of technology, reproduction/copying, the body - using significant artists as examples and applying what we learn to new media and design.</p>

<p>I already love this class because it really makes me think about what &#8220;new&#8221; really means in relation to ITP - where we try, but often fail, to advance the state of the art that looks to merge design, people and technology. The <strong>next steps</strong> for the class are to continue looking at more themes that occur repeatedly over time - making field trips to places in New York where we can see related works.</p>

<h3>Urban Experience in the Networked Age</h3>

<p>In this class, taught by Adam Greenfield, we are examining the development of the modern city as a &#8220;stack&#8221; of people, infrastructure, services and data. We are basically trying to pick apart the modern urban experience, proposing new ways in people can work with non-human actors (connected objects and sensors) and services to live healthier and happier urban lives.</p>

<p>The next steps for this class are to make field trips out into the city observing the environment, people, infrastructure, devices and systems - documenting these different layers of the urban experience using photography and video, before proposing a project in which we'll intervene at this location in some way - maybe with a service or device. This class is going to be a huge challenge, but it's really exciting.</p>

<h3>Poweful Ideas: Useful Tools to Understand the World</h3>

<p>This class is taught by Nancy Hechinger with guest lecturer Alan Kay. Alan is one of the world's foremost experts on computer science; he co-created the concept of object oriented programming, was lead scientist at Atari, a researcher at Xerox PARC and has done pioneering work in the design of computing devices for children. In this class we are using the concept of &#8220;powerful ideas&#8221; (ideas that, when arrived at/agreed upon, fundamentally change the way we understand the world - like the scientific method) to propose more human ways to teach and learn.</p>

<p>This class feels a bit like it's circling the airport, but in the next few weeks I'm confident we'll land the plane - if you know what I mean.</p>

<h3>That's All</h3>

<p>I want to write more about what we're up to this year, but I am short of time - I'll be posting updates on classes and projects as the semester continues.</p>
