		<p class="intro">We had a lot of fun at the <a href="http://www.zefrank.com">ZeFrank</a>, <a href="http://www.contagiousmedia.org/"> Jonah Peretti</a> talk, which was part of the <a href="http://www.sciencegallery.ie/infectious">Infectious</a> season at the Dublin <a href="http://www.sciencegallery.ie/">Science Gallery</a>. </p>


<p>I have been to my share of talks on social media in the last month; in fact I've been to my share, your share and that guy's share as well. Web 2.0 Expo was all social media, all the time; companies and people trying to reverse-engineer the success of social media success stories so that maybe they too can achieve the same success. Usually, this noodling focuses on the mechanics of viral ideas; the how, the who, the when and where - but it rarely focuses on the people, the why, the needs; because these are human problems, and human problems are hard. So, I wasn't dreading the ZeFrank/Peretti talk, but was curious to see if they'd have anything new or interesting to say. Thankfully, they did.</p>

<p><strong>Peretti</strong> is a bit of a nervous public speaker, but his energy and intelligence crackles. He is the founder of <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com">Buzzfeed</a> and is a co-founder of the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">Huffington Post</a>.</p>

<p>He gave a quick &#8220;why is social media different&#8221; intro (which you have no-doubt heard a million times; broadcast/passive Vs networked/active), and then reinforced the idea that it's <strong>hard/impossible to pick apart successful viral ideas</strong> to find the reasons why their successful. He (maybe a <i>little</i> hypocritically&#8230;eek&#8230;sorry)&nbsp; gave a few prerequisites for the success of viral ideas, including:</p>

<ol>
* Tailoring viral ideas to the &#8220;bored at work network&#8221;
* Offering quick, trivial ways for people to contribute and share virals
* Asking passionate advocates (&#8220;crazy people&#8221;) to go a bit further, and share more
* Use real-time analytics to highlight the stuff that's working, and bury the stuff that isn't
</ol>


<p><strong>ZeFrank</strong> is such an entertaining, passionate guy. He presented his thoughts on social media based around a series of moments in his life; steps along the way to where his interests, understanding and work are now. This guy gets it. Users aren't &#8220;users&#8221; - they're people, they have <strong>fears, emotions, likes, dislikes, preferences and hopes</strong>, and sometimes they see things online that resonate with them at a certain level, and make them want to <strong>be part of something broader than the screen or device in front of them</strong>. This was a really refreshing, empathetic, honest take on social media - much needed.</p>

<p>ZeFrank's work is also <strong>a testament to blind, hopeful experimentation</strong>. He showed several examples of viral ideas that went absolutely nowhere - a surprising number actually. Sometimes we are just afraid to try things, fail spectacularly (which he has several times), learn and move on. I think I am a totally victim of this - I have drifted from self-motivated practical/tangible experimentation into analysis and design on behalf of clients, where there's usually far less room to fail. Another much needed kick in the ass to be honest.</p>

<p>So, great night. Thanks to Jonah Peretti and ZeFrank for speaking, and for all the Science Gallery team for organising it.
