      <title>Uncompensated Design Challenges</title>
      <published>2013-01-24T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2013-01-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;New York City has issued a design challenge called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reinventpayphones.splashthat.com/&quot;&gt;Reinvent Payphones&lt;/a&gt; and has asked designers to think of new uses for the city's payphone infrastructure. I attended the information session last night and was really disheartened by the approach being taken by the City. In my opinion, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reinventpayphones.splashthat.com/#rules_nav&quot;&gt;terms of the challenge&lt;/a&gt; are cynical and unfair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers will receive no compensation for their time or materials. They automatically give the city a free, perptetual license to use their work. A &quot;completely separate&quot;, commercial procurement process for the actual development of a new payphone system will be run separately. But, while this process is separate, designers' ideas might be incorporated into that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially Reinvent Payphones boils down to the City using the design community to flesh out the requirements of a highly lucrative, commerical contract - in return for some praise and publicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am just not comfortable with uncompensated design challenges like Reinvent Payphones, especially when the terms are so out of balance. Here are just a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncompensated design challenges are exploitative. When a company or organization with the wherewithal to offer compensation asks a designer to solve a problem and then give the solution to them for free, that is exploitative. Just because the organization arranges for the person to be praised in public for being such a good sport is irrelevant. Publicity is gratifying but it doesn't put food on the table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncompensated design challenges reward the wrong thing. Is the design that gains the widest publicity the best design? Of course not. It's just the one optimized for maximum public acceptance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncompensated design challenges are elitist. Uncompensated design challenges exclude people who have the most to gain from good design from the design process. The underserved and disadvantaged can't gamble their time on the promise of good vibes the possibility of a paying job down the road.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If we take these few problems and run them over time, what do we get? We get a lot of designers doing work but only some living with dignity. We get a class of &quot;successful&quot; designers who live apart from the people who really need the products of good design. We get a design culture where people who shape reputations hold far more power than the people we design for. We optimise for designs that are &quot;right&quot; because they find favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we can do better than this. I'd love to hear your thoughts on uncompensated design challenges, and ways of encouraging participation and collaboration without exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upstream Color</title>
      <published>2013-01-20T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2013-01-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8517/8400307938_80ea7a7188_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a still photo from Upstream Color. A man and a woman lie together, fully dressed in an empty bath tub&quot; / class=&quot;photo&quot;&gt;
I'm excited to see Shane Carruth's new film, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shanecarruth.com/film/upstreamcolor&quot;&gt;Upstream Color&lt;/a&gt;. Carruth is the writer and director of one of my favourite films, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shanecarruth/film/primer&quot;&gt;Primer&lt;/a&gt;. Made on a shoestring budget and released in 2004, Primer updates a well-worn mainstay of science fiction storytelling, the &quot;time-machines are probably a bad idea&quot; tale. The film's major innovation was to show, in ambitious detail, the practical and emotional burdens of time travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/53890508?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;394&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As life for the two protagonists divides into a tangle of recursive, competing timelines we're asked to consider how complicated things would get if more people had access to the time machine. Like all time-machine stories, Primer is a moral fable about the limits of human imagination and the hazard of acting purely in self interest. It's an energetic, rich, and very rewarding film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope is that Upstream Color comes close to being as entertaining as Primer. The press notes and trailer for the film are compelling in their vagueness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man and woman are drawn together, entangled in the lifecycle of an ageless organism. Identity becomes an illusion as they struggle to assemble the loose fragments of wrecked lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/57342043?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Upstream Color will be shown at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13010/upstream_color&quot;&gt;Sundance Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; next week before going on limited/guerrilla release in April.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Story of Film</title>
      <published>2013-01-08T00:00:00Z</published>

      <content type="html">&lt;iframe width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/usQIoKoJSFM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoying Mark Cousins' series &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2044056/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Story of Film: An Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is now available to stream on &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Story_of_Film_An_Odyssey/70261400?locale=en-US&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. It is a beautifully made documentary broken into 15, one hour-long episodes. &lt;em&gt;The Story of Film&lt;/em&gt; traces the history of film from its birth through to the current day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a lot of film historians, Cousins really goes out of his way to show examples of films from all over the world, like Yevgeni Bauer's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0005916/&quot;&gt;After Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Posle Smerti&lt;/em&gt;) from Russia, made in 1915 (above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really comes across is the rapid change that cinema underwent in the decades after its invention. By the time film was a couple of decades old it had been transformed from a curiosity into an art form. Fascination with the technology of filmmaking had been superseded by a fascination with new forms of storytelling enabled by technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the 1920s filmmakers had formulated, refined and then deliberately subverted successive forms of film-making. The grammar of film was constantly being re-written and the result was innumerable, fascinating, deeply different films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison, today's cinema - and indeed all media - look timid and conformist. The web is about as old as cinema was during its heady days of experimentation and is becoming more cynical and homogenous each year. If the history of cinema tells us anything it's that we shouldn't be afraid to write a new rule book, or indeed to burn that rule book when things become too familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Story of Film: An Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; is inspiring. It has put fire in my belly. I really recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Irish News Media - Two Decades Wasted?</title>
      <published>2013-01-04T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2013-01-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What I find most disappointing about the recent statements from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nni.ie/v2/broad/portal.php?content=../_includes/prportal.php&amp;date=4th%20Jan%202013&amp;year=2013&quot;&gt;National Newspapers of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; isn't that they assert that linking to a website could require licensing - that old chestnut is as old as the web itself. What is most disappointing is that it's a clear sign that the Irish news media have done very little to prepare for the opportunities that the web now offers them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we've seen in the last few weeks from NNI is old thinking -  an entrenched mindset that can't consider the value of content unbundled from a physical medium or an insular website. If hyperlinks are beyond the Irish news media's ken, what about complex economic issues, data-driven journalism, mobile computing, video journalism, blogging?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contend that two decades is adequate time for any industry to hone the critical faculties, business models and skills made relevant by new technologies. Similarly, if you're a journalist and your skillset hasn't expanded to include an understanding of copyright, mass-participation in media production, ethics in the digital age, data analysis and online publishing then your window of relevance is probably going to be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the newspapers that NNI represents keep pace with Irish people and contemporary society or let them die. No more holding back the seas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's January. In six months time we will leave New York bound for who-knows-where. I have become deeply attached to this city, to my friends who live here, to the seemingly infinite possibility of the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The J Visa is a cruel mistress - you come for a while then you go for a while. All we can do is try to make every day we have left in New York count, and thank our lucky stars that we got the chance to be here, even for a short while. I am really, really excited about the future - but leaving will be hard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ayrton Senna in Flow</title>
      <published>2012-12-01T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2012-12-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8235583569_edc746d19e_o.gif&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;An animated gif showing a POV shot from Ayrton Senna's formula 1 racing car during the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the documentary &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1424432/&quot;&gt;Senna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Ayrton Senna describes his mental state during the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That day I suddenly realised that I was no longer driving it conscious, and I was in a different dimension for me. The circuit for me was a tunnel, which I was just going, going going…and I realised I was well beyond my conscious understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since watching the film this morning I've been thinking about human-machine interfaces (for the first time in a while). I wonder whether the type of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi&quot;&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; Senna describes requires an interface so simple that it melts into the background. What are the critical ingredients of an experience like this? When is an experience like this undesirable? These aren't new questions, but again - I have haven't thought about them in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Incidentally, in the race Senna built up a substantial lead over Alain Prost before crashing out on the 65th lap. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oliver Sacks is Looking for Indigo</title>
      <published>2012-11-11T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2012-11-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In his talk at The Cooper Union last Friday, Oliver Sacks described his use of hallucinogenic drugs in his search for the colour indigo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were many different motives; it was all a long time ago. It was all between '63 and '67. I had been puzzling about indigo. Indigo was inserted into the spectrum by Newton, so was orange; he felt there should be seven colours as there are seven notes in the musical scale, but it seemed to me that no two people agreed what indigo was like - and it was felt in fact that the pigment derived from the indigo plant was not really indigo. I decided I wanted to see indigo. I couldn't imagine it, but I thought I might be able to hallucinate it so I built a sort of pharmacological launchpad. A base of amphetamine, then some LSD, with a little cannabis on top. It got me fairly pickled; stoned is the right word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I felt ready I said &quot;I want to see indigo &lt;em&gt;now!&lt;/em&gt;&quot; and as if thrown by a paintbrush, a trembling, pear-shaped blob of the most wonderful colour appeared on the wall. &lt;em&gt;Indigo&lt;/em&gt;. It not only seemed wonderfully luminous, but it filled me with a sort of mystical - almost religious joy. I felt it was numinous as well as luminous, and although I'm an old Jewish atheist I thought &quot;this is the colour of heaven&quot; and I thought &quot;this is the colour which Gioto tried to get but never could, and maybe this is a colour that no longer exists on the earth&quot;. And I leant forward in a sort of ecstasy and it vanished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt very heartbroken, and in fact for months afterwards I would turn over little stones and things. I was looking for indigo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did experience it once again and that was when I came to New York in '65 I went to a concert in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the Egyptology gallery and in the first half of the concert there was some Monteverdi which transported me and it was sort of rapture. In the interval I wandered into the Egyptology gallery and saw there was some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_lazuli&quot;&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt; amulets and so-forth and some of them were indigo and I thought &quot;thank god - it exists in the world&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second half of the concert I didn't like the music much. I became a little bored and irritable, I thought I'd go and get a sip of indigo, but when I went back the lapis lazuli was just blue and mauve and puce and I've never seen indigo again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He finished the story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew it would have to be a blue of some sort. So I pre-determined it. I didn't say I want to see indigo and then see a splotch of orange. So I played a part, then it took this leap, helped by the launchpad, from imagination to hallucination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally I'm not recommending the experience, although if you can get it from music, or from falling in love, or from medication, or from scenery - that's really a much better way. I'm glad I survived my drug period, many of my friends didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>John Hockenberry Introduces Oliver Sacks at the World Science Festival</title>
      <published>2012-11-10T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2012-11-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of seeing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oliversacks.com/&quot;&gt;Dr. Oliver Sacks&lt;/a&gt; in conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hockenberry&quot;&gt;John Hockenberry&lt;/a&gt; at the Cooper Union last night. Sacks was speaking about his latest book &lt;em&gt;Hallucinations&lt;/em&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldsciencefestival.com/webcasts/sacks?/events/sacks&quot;&gt;World Science Festival&lt;/a&gt;. It was a really great event, not least because of John Hockenberry's stunning introduction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tonight we're going to explore this notion of hallucinations. There's a really young crowd here. I hasten to say don't try this at home but I suspect many of you have. Oh well. Be that as it may. Let me tell you a little hallucination story here in this hall, where we might even get a glimpse of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/liho/historyculture/summary.htm&quot;&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/a&gt; if we're lucky. All of New York this week is something of a hallucination. My neighborhood looks like Gaza. We're experiencing a sense of perceptual distortion from our encounters with the natural world this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about a young fellow who studied mathematics at the University of Chicago a couple of decades ago who had a predisposition for psilocybin mushrooms in the course of his mathematical studies and was on a trip, hitchhiking across the country, and got in a car with some lovely individuals who said &quot;look we're driving straight through to Massachusetts and here we've got these amphetamines that are keeping us awake, why don't you stay awake with us?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got in the back seat of the car, we took these strange pills but alas the pills did not do what they were supposed to for the driver and at a certain point in Pennsylvania she drove off the road and went down a 200 foot embankment. I was in the back seat of that car and when I came to consciousness, a few moments after the car reached the bottom of the hill, I realized that I was probably paralyzed for life and was staring through the shattered windshield of a Chevrolet Nova up at a beautiful blue sky, bleeding from a skull fracture and serious set of internal injuries and the blood from the injuries to my head were seeping into the area around my eyes and my eyes were turning completely red and I was looking at the world through this strange blood-filter. I could see clearly, and all of a sudden as I looked through this shattered windshield I could see not the sky anymore, I could see this automobile and there was this sad young man in the car and there were ambulance crews trying to saw this car in half and I looked down and though &quot;oh that's a terrible situation - what's going on? I hope that fellow is alright&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I watched for a while and it was terribly noisy and I was feeling very relieved that I was far away from that mess and I stared at it for a while, and all of a sudden the view began to get a little dark and everything sort of rushed like the sound of a train and all of a sudden I realized that I was the person in the car and they had in fact managed to saw the roof off of the car and pull me to safely. I lost consciousness at that point and woke up in a recovery room in a hospital days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happened? What was going on in my brain during this event, because I remember it vividly, vividly and can recall precisely what I was looking at from down in the trees, down on what was happening to me, something I couldn't actually have possibly seen because I was in the vehicle. Was it just some &quot;spiritual - whoa - intense experience&quot; or does it reveal something fundamental about the organization of the brain? That's what we're going to explore tonight and we certainly have, as you already heard, the best person on planet Earth to help explore it with us. He's an author, scholar, doctor, clinician, professor and in many ways the pre-eminent storyteller of the brain. Please welcome Doctor, Professor, friend; Oliver Sacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to blog about Dr. Sacks' talk separately, but I wanted to highlight Hockenberry's introduction. It really was quite something.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More Flickr Handwringing</title>
      <published>2012-11-09T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2012-11-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote this as a comment on &lt;a href=&quot;http://stewf.tumblr.com/post/35334085915/flickr-is-dead-long-live-flickr&quot;&gt;Stephen Coles' article&lt;/a&gt; about Flickr and thought it was probably worth snipping and keeping; maybe even expanding upon some time. The crux of Stephen's original article is this paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flickr is certainly not the all-purpose photography social network it once was. There is no doubt Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and other more immediate, accessible, and — most importantly — mobile-savvy venues took that position. But Flickr is still a haven for professional photography, and for the visual documentation of specialized fields, because nothing is better for tagging, archiving, organizing, research, collaborating, curating, and finding others who share your particular interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see what you're saying, but Flickr is not commercially viable as a place for &quot;professional photographers&quot; (whatever that means anymore). It needs the blend of subscription revenue, mass-participation, exposure to advertising and experimentation that have supported it since it launched. It needs that long tail of people who are trying it out and who might become subscribers. It needs the huge percentage of people who might upload dozens or hundreds of photos, but look at thousands. (For me, the subscription cost is cheap for the value that Flickr offers in isolation, but seemingly expensive when compared to other services.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flickr has always done a good job of focussing on doing a limited number of things really well; sharing, interoperability (its API), privacy, tagging, annotating photographs, the Commons - they designed the state of the art for much of what we take for granted in media sharing on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flickr hasn't responded in any way to the growth of mobile photography - the most significant thing to happen to casual snapping, reportage photography and the aesthetic of photography in decades. The mobile applications it has released have done little more than damage its brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Heather Champ left Flickr efforts to understand and nurture the Flickr community have really withered on the vine. They've lost other, similarly talented folks in design, engineering - these people have found homes in start-ups and more dynamic online services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flickr is becoming a storage device and a community of people who regard themselves as being above the churning sea of content being produced by everyday photographers. It was never designed to be either; it was designed to get as many people as possible (casual and passionate alike) to share photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flickr has lost its way - it's in the expensive mainframe business when the world is buying desktops; it panders to an idealised customer as the actual customer moves on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said all of that, it could come back, it has the potential to come back - but not without taking a good look at how photography actually exists in people's lives today, not what an elite think photography should be - then designing for those needs. It's an exciting prospect, they can do it; I very much hope they do - but time is running out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Update, Continuing Conversation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen has &lt;a href=&quot;http://stewf.tumblr.com/post/35334085915/flickr-is-dead-long-live-flickr&quot;&gt;replied to my comment&lt;/a&gt;, he has some good points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree that Flickr has modernizing work to do, but I reject the increasingly common assertion that a platform must cater to the lowest common denominator in order to be relevant or successful. There is room on the web for outfits who do certain things very well and leave the rest to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which I responded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's where we disagree. I look at the photos being snapped by people on their phones and am blown away. I want as many people as possible to take photos, to understand the medium, to really get visual culture. I think Flickr is a great platform for opening up all of that great content and experience to people. I don't see mass participation as lowest common denominator - I see it as an exciting laboratory of culture from which professional photographers have more to learn than fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for whether a service like Flickr needs to be all things to all people - I hear what you're saying, but Flickr was set up to afford particular great things, like sharing - rather than to afford particular groups of people who knew a lot about photography. The fact that the community is becoming less diverse, and pro photographers still find the experience satisfying isn't a surprise. That more serious photographers enjoy feeling like they have an entire web service to themselves now is not surprising - everybody loves a clubhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photography is the masses' answer to oil painting; and people who have spent a lot of money on cameras feel like it needs to be oil painting again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Flickr can tweak itself, just a bit, so that it reflects camera culture as it exists today then it will be a stronger service, a service more likely to survive financially, pro photographers will have something to learn from and teach to. It's when you get these collisions that you get exciting stuff. The alternative is stagnation and comfort; that's not photography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>What Would It Take?</title>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We were mostly unaffected by the hurricane - a few trees down in our neighbourhood, a day without internet access, some hassle getting to and from work. We were among the lucky ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took some time to cycle around the city last week and the damage is immense; dozens of lives lost, city block after city block in eerie silence, homes and businesses converted into wet piles of debris at the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night as I walked down Mercer Street in a near-blizzard I wondered what it would take to completely destroy a society like this - built around access to technologies like clean water, electric power and reliable heat. Probably not a lot; maybe a storm like Sandy every year, with an off-season punctuated by smaller storms like last night's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard not to feel insignificant in the face of the sea, the rain, and the wind. We shape our cities and our bodies around the comfortable activities that new technologies afford. The bias of modernity towards comfort leaves us vulnerable when comfort is not the priority - when living becomes coping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thankful that we were unaffected, and thankful for being given a tiny glimpse of what hardship actually looks like. I get the feeling that I'll be noodling on the storm and its aftermath for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;
