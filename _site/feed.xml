      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight I'm visiting Visual Communication students at the Pratt Institute to give feedback on their assignment &quot;Something Useful&quot;. The students have been asked to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncover, research, and visualize the innerworkings of a frequently used system that tends to go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a cool assignment, and I am looking forward to seeing the students' progress. I'll also be giving a brief talk about doing research to inform a design project. Thanks to Pratt instructor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.genalodesigns.com/&quot;&gt;Bobby Genalo&lt;/a&gt; for inviting me along.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Everywhere I Have Ever Lived</title>
      <published>2013-02-03T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2013-02-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're leaving New York in June, departing for &lt;em&gt;we don't know where yet&lt;/em&gt;. I can hardly believe that I'm moving again. By my count I've lived in 4 cities and approximately 12 houses/apartments in the past decade. This is the first time I've actually made a list of those places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8325/8436957984_60f1b30394_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Satellite photo of Kilbarrack Road, Dublin&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot;/&gt;
My childhood home on Kilbarrack Road in Dublin. There's just too much to say about this great house. I drifted away slowly over the course of 2004/2005. My Dad sold the house few years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8052/8436956268_39398a9b97_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Satellite photo of East 53rd Street, Hyde Park, Chicago&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot;/&gt;
In the summer of 2002 I spent 4 months living on East 53rd Street in Hyde Park, Chicago. I couldn't find a job, and was down to my last few dollars when I happened to bump into some other Irish people who worked at the Adler Planetarium. They recommended me for a job there, and I scraped by for another 2.5 months before heading back to Dublin. A very strange summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8221/8436957516_7c215675b7_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Satellite photo of Shanowen Road, Dublin&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot;/&gt;
For about three months of 2004 I lived in an apartment on Shanowen Road near DCU. My housemates were Michael Moriarty and Nicky Gallogly. I can't for the life of me remember how the three of us ended up living together, but it was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8237/8435872435_c071b5b63f_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Satellite photo of Glasnevin, Dublin&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot;/&gt;
For a very brief period of 2004 or 2005, maybe a couple of months, I lived somewhere in Glasnevin, Dublin. I don't know the exact address and have incredibly patcy memories of this whole experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8369/8435883069_b8b0abe50d_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Satellite photo of Dargle Road, Dublin&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot;/&gt;
In 2005 I moved into a small house on Dargle Road in Drumcondra.  My housemates were Ciara Gogarty, Aoife McNamara, Eoin Norton, and for a very brief period, Padraig Kilbride. The house was decrepit, the landlord was a spiv, and the dishes were never done, but we had fun there. The incident with the rat wasn't much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8435872221_606ab2c1ca_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Satellite photo of Booterstown Park, Dublin&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot;/&gt;
In 2006 I moved to a rather grand house on Booterstown Park; my first foray onto the South Side of Dublin. My housemates were Karl Podesta, Louise Connolly, and Johnny Callaghan. Even though this was a very quiet street in a very quiet area, I really enjoyed living here. My room was huge, the garden was great, the kitchen was great, and everybody did their bit to keep the house in working order. It was a really pleasant experience all round. Not cheap though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8224/8435873423_1451725dee_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Satellite photo of Titania Street, Belfast&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot;/&gt;
In 2007 I quit my wretched job in management consulting and moved to Belfast to work at Front (now part of Monotype). I lived in a little house on Titania Street off the Cregagh Road, first in the attic room, then in a nicer front-facing room. My constantly rotating cast of housemates included Emma, Aasa, Greg, and Mario. They were all very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8463/8435871471_3cb41c70e0_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Satellite photo of Rossmore Avenue, Belfast&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot;/&gt;
In February of 2009 the constantly changing cast of characters at Titania Street, and a desire to be closer to both work and a swimming pool, prompted me to relocate across the city to Rossmore Avenue. My new housemates were Cassie, Breda, Chris, Johann, and for a short time, Emma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8075/8436971692_09286e4923_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Satellite photo of Rossmore Avenue, Belfast&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot;/&gt;
I spent weekdays in Belfast, but came back to Dublin on weekends to stay with Cliona. I was frequently to be found at her place on Parnell Street. Cliona's flatmates, Beatriz and then Kate, tolerated me beyond the call of duty and reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8502/8435871615_d9a2009481_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Satellite photo of North Great George's Street, Dublin&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot;/&gt;
In September of 2009 I managed to persuade the folks at Front to let me work from Dublin 2 days a week. Me and Cliona rented a really nice basement/garden apartment on North Great George's Street in Dublin. This is probably the most fabulous place I will ever live. We had a spare bedroom and a huge garden. We are able to have parties without bothering a soul. We spent a happy year here in the run up to our wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8080/8436957678_23eb4605cc_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Satellite photo of Sagimor Gardens, Belfast&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot;/&gt;
In 2009/2010 I was spending 3 nights a week in Belfast, and 4 nights a week in Dublin, so to cut down on costs I moved out of Rossmore Avenue in Belfast and rented a tiny room in a house in East Belfast. The owner of the house, Sarah, was very nice. She was saving up so that she could quit her job and go sailing for a year. I don't know if she ever went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8435873717_e92f8a68e3_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Satellite photo of Ocean Avenue, Brooklyn&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot;/&gt;
In August 2010 I arrived in New York to start at NYU. I spent a couple of weeks staying with Courtney Kelly, but soon found a great apartment on Ocean Avenue in Prospect Leffert Gardens. Cliona arrived in New York a couple of months later, and we are still living on Ocean Avenue 2.5 years later. This really feels like home. I hope, probably in vain, that the next place we live is as good to us as this place has been.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tom Sorell on Surveillance</title>
      <published>2013-02-02T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2013-02-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the latest episode of the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://philosophybites.com/2013/01/tom-sorell-on-surveillance.html&quot;&gt;Philosophy Bites&lt;/a&gt; podcast, philosopher Tom Sorell eloquently describes why surveillance-free spaces are important. Sorell is taking part in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.surveille.eu/&quot;&gt;Surveille project&lt;/a&gt; that is examining the usage and ethics of surveillance in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one has to answer the question &quot;what in general makes privacy valuable?&quot; it may be that you need privacy in order to be an autonomous person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even to be you, you need a space of autonomous reflection, otherwise you might become the mouthpiece for the people around you. If you're never able to have this space that's afforded by the private mind, you just become a mouthpiece for the official view, or the views of your parents, or the views of your friendship group. You need a space in which you're able to put your own stamp on your beliefs, and that means coming up with reasons for them from your own point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't agree with everything Sorell says (I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; believe that the use of surveillance necessarily involves a power relationship), but what he has to say is thought-provoking. Surveillance is an important issue to consider, especially given the ubiquity of social software, connected cameras, and rapidly shifting norms around what constitutes public and private space. It's good to see the EU funding work like this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Nature of Code Book and Videos</title>
      <published>2013-02-01T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2013-02-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://natureofcode.com/&quot;&gt;The Nature of Code&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful creative programming class taught at ITP by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shiffman.net/&quot;&gt;Dan Shiffman&lt;/a&gt;. In The Nature of Code, students learn how to programme software applications that mimic nature in some way, covering topics like gravity, wind, flocking, learning and evolution. For my own final project I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/41397044&quot;&gt;a little simulation&lt;/a&gt; where creatures are born, flock, find food, react to danger, age and die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class was a real revelation for me. I wasn't good at maths or physics in school, and only really started to grasp concepts like trigonometry, vectors and forces in Dan's class. I really wish that a class like this (and more creative methods of teaching) had been available when I was much younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/58734251?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;394&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dan has just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0985930802/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0985930802&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=natureofcode-20&quot;&gt;released a book&lt;/a&gt; that covers, and expands upon, the content of the class. There's a freely available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples&quot;&gt;library of code&lt;/a&gt; and Dan is &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/channels/464686&quot;&gt;recording a series of (highly entertaining) videos&lt;/a&gt; to help students along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't recommend The Nature of Code highly enough. Enjoy the content from the class, and help it finds its way to people teaching maths, physics, biology, or computing to young people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uncompensated Design Challenges</title>
      <published>2013-01-24T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2013-01-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;New York City has issued a design challenge called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reinventpayphones.splashthat.com/&quot;&gt;Reinvent Payphones&lt;/a&gt; and has asked designers to think of new uses for the city's payphone infrastructure. I went along to the information session last night and was pretty disheartened. I just don't think that the approach being taken by the city will result in a good outcome for the city, or the designers who take part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start of a successful design project is a clear statement of need, a description of a context and some sense of what is expected - constraints. With Reinvent Payphones there is no clear statement of why the City needs or wants to reinvent payones other than the expiration of the current commercial payphone contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The City can't offer any useful data about payphone usage, the role that the phones play in the life of the city, or the changing context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They give &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reinventpayphones.splashthat.com/#nyc_nav&quot;&gt;a list of things that are important&lt;/a&gt;, but don't say which things are more important than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the City was really invested in the outcome of the challenge then more care and attention should have been put into writing the brief; describing the context, offering useful data, stating a problem, setting clear goals - and then being flexible about the form of the solution (maybe a reinvented payphone isn't a reinvented payphone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, there are the rules. Even though designers are encouraged to design and build prototypes, they will receive no compensation for their time or materials. They automatically give the city a free, perptetual license to use their work. A commercial procurement process for the development of a new payphone system will be run &quot;completely separately&quot;. But, the City acknowledges that designers' ideas might be incorporated into that process. How is this fair?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the very poorly-stated brief and the harsh terms, Reinvent Payphones seems to boil down to the City using members of the design community to flesh out the requirements of a commerical contract, in return for some praise and publicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, this falls into the category of uncompensated design, or spec work, and it's disheartening to see a City like New York trawling for spec work. Here are just a few of my reasons why challenges like this are bad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncompensated design challenges are exploitative. When a company or organization with the wherewithal to offer compensation asks a designer to solve a problem and then give the solution to them for free, that is exploitative. Just because the organization arranges for the person to be praised in public for being such a good sport is irrelevant. Publicity is gratifying but it doesn't put food on the table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncompensated design challenges reward the wrong thing. Is the design that gains the widest publicity the best design? Of course not. It's just the one optimized for maximum public acceptance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncompensated design challenges are elitist. Uncompensated design challenges exclude people who have the most to gain from good design from the design process. The underserved and disadvantaged can't gamble their time on the promise of good vibes, or the possibility of a paying job down the road.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If we take these few problems and run them over time, what do we get? We get a lot of designers doing work but only some living with dignity. We get a class of &quot;successful&quot; designers who live apart from the people who really need the products of good design. We get a design culture where people who shape reputations hold far more power than the people we design for. We optimise for designs that are &quot;right&quot; because they find favour. We separate designers from the context (and the &quot;client&quot;) and expect them to just riff on ideas, as though that's the same thing as design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not alone. Universities and professional associations urge caution around design challenges and spec work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.design.cmu.edu/files/school_of_design_position_on_solicitations_for_competitions.pdf&quot;&gt;The School of Design at Carnegie Mellon University&lt;/a&gt;:  We discourage proposals for competitions because they are usually a solicitation of design concepts to be produced on a speculative basis by the professionals you are considering. We do not participate in, or promote projects that essentially ask students to design on 'spec'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aiga.org/position-spec-work/&quot;&gt;AIGA&lt;/a&gt; believes that professional designers should be compensated fairly for their work and should negotiate the ownership or use rights of their intellectual and creative property through an engagement with clients. To that end, AIGA strongly encourages designers to enter into client projects with full engagement to show the value of their creative endeavor, and to be aware of all potential risks before entering into speculative work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that New York City can do better than this. I'd love to hear your thoughts about design challenges. Maybe you can think of ways to encourage participation without exploitation?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upstream Color</title>
      <published>2013-01-20T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2013-01-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8517/8400307938_80ea7a7188_b_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a still photo from Upstream Color. A man and a woman lie together, fully dressed in an empty bath tub&quot; / class=&quot;photo&quot;&gt;
I'm excited to see Shane Carruth's new film, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shanecarruth.com/film/upstreamcolor&quot;&gt;Upstream Color&lt;/a&gt;. Carruth is the writer and director of one of my favourite films, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shanecarruth/film/primer&quot;&gt;Primer&lt;/a&gt;. Made on a shoestring budget and released in 2004, Primer updates a well-worn mainstay of science fiction storytelling, the &quot;time-machines are probably a bad idea&quot; tale. The film's major innovation was to show, in ambitious detail, the practical and emotional burdens of time travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/53890508?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;394&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As life for the two protagonists divides into a tangle of recursive, competing timelines we're asked to consider how complicated things would get if more people had access to the time machine. Like all time-machine stories, Primer is a moral fable about the limits of human imagination and the hazard of acting purely in self interest. It's an energetic, rich, and very rewarding film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope is that Upstream Color comes close to being as entertaining as Primer. The press notes and trailer for the film are compelling in their vagueness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man and woman are drawn together, entangled in the lifecycle of an ageless organism. Identity becomes an illusion as they struggle to assemble the loose fragments of wrecked lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/57342043?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Upstream Color will be shown at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13010/upstream_color&quot;&gt;Sundance Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; next week before going on limited/guerrilla release in April.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Story of Film</title>
      <published>2013-01-08T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2013-01-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;iframe width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/usQIoKoJSFM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoying Mark Cousins' series &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2044056/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Story of Film: An Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is now available to stream on &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Story_of_Film_An_Odyssey/70261400?locale=en-US&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. It is a beautifully made documentary broken into 15, one hour-long episodes. &lt;em&gt;The Story of Film&lt;/em&gt; traces the history of film from its birth through to the current day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a lot of film historians, Cousins really goes out of his way to show examples of films from all over the world, like Yevgeni Bauer's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0005916/&quot;&gt;After Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Posle Smerti&lt;/em&gt;) from Russia, made in 1915 (above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really comes across is the rapid change that cinema underwent in the decades after its invention. By the time film was a couple of decades old it had been transformed from a curiosity into an art form. Fascination with the technology of filmmaking had been superseded by a fascination with new forms of storytelling enabled by technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the 1920s filmmakers had formulated, refined and then deliberately subverted successive forms of film-making. The grammar of film was constantly being re-written and the result was innumerable, fascinating, deeply different films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison, today's cinema - and indeed all media - look timid and conformist. The web is about as old as cinema was during its heady days of experimentation and is becoming more cynical and homogenous each year. If the history of cinema tells us anything it's that we shouldn't be afraid to write a new rule book, or indeed to burn that rule book when things become too familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Story of Film: An Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; is inspiring. It has put fire in my belly. I really recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Irish News Media - Two Decades Wasted?</title>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What I find most disappointing about the recent statements from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nni.ie/v2/broad/portal.php?content=../_includes/prportal.php&amp;date=4th%20Jan%202013&amp;year=2013&quot;&gt;National Newspapers of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; isn't that they assert that linking to a website could require licensing - that old chestnut is as old as the web itself. What is most disappointing is that it's a clear sign that the Irish news media have done very little to prepare for the opportunities that the web now offers them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we've seen in the last few weeks from NNI is old thinking -  an entrenched mindset that can't consider the value of content unbundled from a physical medium or an insular website. If hyperlinks are beyond the Irish news media's ken, what about complex economic issues, data-driven journalism, mobile computing, video journalism, blogging?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contend that two decades is adequate time for any industry to hone the critical faculties, business models and skills made relevant by new technologies. Similarly, if you're a journalist and your skillset hasn't expanded to include an understanding of copyright, mass-participation in media production, ethics in the digital age, data analysis and online publishing then your window of relevance is probably going to be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the newspapers that NNI represents keep pace with Irish people and contemporary society or let them die. No more holding back the seas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Beginning of The End</title>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's January. In six months time we will leave New York bound for who-knows-where. I have become deeply attached to this city, to my friends who live here, to the seemingly infinite possibility of the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The J Visa is a cruel mistress - you come for a while then you go for a while. All we can do is try to make every day we have left in New York count, and thank our lucky stars that we got the chance to be here, even for a short while. I am really, really excited about the future - but leaving will be hard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ayrton Senna in Flow</title>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8235583569_edc746d19e_o.gif&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;An animated gif showing a POV shot from Ayrton Senna's formula 1 racing car during the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the documentary &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1424432/&quot;&gt;Senna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Ayrton Senna describes his mental state during the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That day I suddenly realised that I was no longer driving it conscious, and I was in a different dimension for me. The circuit for me was a tunnel, which I was just going, going going…and I realised I was well beyond my conscious understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since watching the film this morning I've been thinking about human-machine interfaces (for the first time in a while). I wonder whether the type of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi&quot;&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; Senna describes requires an interface so simple that it melts into the background. What are the critical ingredients of an experience like this? When is an experience like this undesirable? These aren't new questions, but again - I have haven't thought about them in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Incidentally, in the race Senna built up a substantial lead over Alain Prost before crashing out on the 65th lap. &lt;/p&gt;
