      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When Crackerjack found the combination of numbers and letters that when, lightly encrypted, matched the string in the password file - the computer would beep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd get up from the dinner table and walk to the computer in our living room. I'd see what password this particular user had chosen and how long the program had left to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the next day I would have access to hundreds of UNIX accounts at a nearby university. I would telnet in, look around, then log off. The fun part was over, and being 13 I lacked the imagination to do anything creative, let alone malicious with the accounts. This was just an incremental step along the path of Lego, magnets, my microscope, a 286, our first modem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks here in the US I have remembered and thought repeatedly about this long-lost time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's election season, and there is something about the quality of the discourse here that reminds me of brute force password cracking; candidates rapidly cycling through a set of signs in an attempt to elicit a desirable signal. Word, sentence, image, emotion out - data, refinement, ballot in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mind of the voter is the hashed password, the barrel of a lock. The home directory, the other side of the door - they are not concerns for today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lance and Triathlon</title>
      <published>2012-10-11T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2012-10-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To call today's New York Times article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/sports/cycling/lance-armstrong-draws-mixed-reception-from-triathlon-community.html&quot;&gt;Armstrong Finds a Mixed Reception in Triathlon&lt;/a&gt; utterly disingenuous would be putting it mildly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lance Armstrong has been completely banned from the internationally governed (i.e. non-corporate) forms of triathlon because &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyclinginvestigation.usada.org/&quot;&gt;he used drugs to cheat in cycling&lt;/a&gt;. He has taken part in a small number of triathlons that were so desperate for publicity they opted out of the sport's rulebook and insurance coverage to allow him to race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing an equivalence between his official, global ban and his invitation to take part in rogue races is wrong. Saying that this represents &quot;mixed feelings&quot; is shabby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a golfer was caught taking drugs and banned from playing in any tournament that followed the official rules of golf, but was then invited to play big drive, trick shot and crazy golf tournaments, you would call that &lt;em&gt;being banned from golf&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because it's Lance doesn't mean it's complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finishing Things</title>
      <published>2012-10-03T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2012-10-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like most people I am better at starting things than I am at finishing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most successful projects I've worked on have been defined by how they are completed. Successful projects seem to flow backwards in time from the desired results, through the phase of making things, to the beginning where we started the journey. (Which reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/10751957&quot; title=&quot;On Perspective&quot;&gt;this great talk&lt;/a&gt; by Charles Leadbeater)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I finished a project; and while it's still fresh in my mind, I wanted to write down some of the loose ends that defined the end of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Finishing a Project - A Checklist of Sorts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I stood beside my colleagues and presented the project to a group of people who care about the work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We discussed how the impact that the work will have, and how project might be continued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We said thank you to these people, and to the people who have supported us along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strike&quot;&gt;We celebrated&lt;/span&gt;. I didn't celebrate with the team because my brother was in town, but we'll get together soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I moved moved the documentation and rough-work from the project to a place where people can access it easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I explained what documentation would be most useful in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I archived all the files and documentation related to the project, moving them out of my current projects folder into my completed projects folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm now actively thinking about what else I can do to finish projects in a more complete way; finishing in a practical sense, finishing in an emotional sense. By doing this I hope to improve the way that all the work that goes before the finish unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any thoughts or advice for me, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clinical Trials Map</title>
      <published>2012-09-19T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2012-09-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the last few months I've been working on design projects with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. I've noticed that the medical staff are constantly improving how they work; many patients are enrolled in clinical trials so that new techniques and technologies can be assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of digging I found that there's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot;&gt;central registry of clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;, including the ones taking place at MSKCC, available online. It's a really interesting dataset; there's a lot of information available about each trial - including the location where each trial is taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see what trials are taking place in Brooklyn where I live, and in some other cities around the world, so I wrote a little application that retrieves data from the registry and populates &lt;a href=&quot;http://trials.paulmay.org&quot;&gt; a series of maps&lt;/a&gt;. I'll be working to improve these maps over the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://trials.paulmay.org&quot;&gt;Explore the maps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/paulmmay&quot;&gt;tell me what you think&lt;/a&gt;. If you want more details about how the maps were made, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Method&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All data in the current maps was retrieved on the 16th of September 2012 and will be updated once a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial data is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot;&gt;clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;. My application requests a list of open trials currently accepting new participants taking place in &lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?recr=Open&amp;no_unk=Y&amp;cntry1=EU%3AIE&amp;locn=Dublin&amp;displayxml=true&quot;&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?recr=Open&amp;no_unk=Y&amp;cntry1=ES%3ACN&amp;locn=beijing&amp;displayxml=true&quot;&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?recr=Open&amp;no_unk=Y&amp;cntry1=EU%3AGB&amp;locn=London&amp;displayxml=true&quot;&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?recr=Open&amp;no_unk=Y&amp;cntry1=EU%3AES&amp;locn=Barcelona&amp;displayxml=true&quot;&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?recr=Open&amp;no_unk=Y&amp;cntry1=NA%3AUS&amp;state1=NA%3AUS%3ANY&amp;locn=Brooklyn&amp;displayxml=true&quot;&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; and a list of studies is returned. Studies with unknown status are not returned. Each study is then &lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00463294?displayxml=true&quot;&gt;retrieved individually&lt;/a&gt;. Each study has a number of &quot;facilities&quot; associated with it where the trial is being carried out - the address of these facilities is passed to the Google Maps API which returns location information. The latitude and longitude is used to populate a map made using &lt;a href=&quot;http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/&quot;&gt;Leaflet&lt;/a&gt;. (I'll be releasing the application on GitHub when I've documented it and cleaned it up a bit.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;caveats&quot;&gt;Caveats&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is just a little experiment&lt;/strong&gt; and the maps aren't offered with any guarantee of completeness, availability, quality or accuracy. You shouldn't use these maps to satisfy anything other than idle curiosity. If you want accurate trial data you should get it directly from &lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot;&gt;clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geocoding is inherently flaky&lt;/strong&gt;; if Google Maps couldn't return a lat/lon for the facility where the trial is taking place, that trial is not shown at all. Even when Google Maps did return a lat/lon the location should be treated as approximate. In many cases trials are shown at the center of cities because Google Maps can't identify a more specific location (e.g. because  O'Connell Street in Dublin is returned when you search for &quot;Dublin, Ireland&quot; a lot of clinical trials appear to be taking place on O'Connell street).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Showing lots of markers close to each other on a map is a non-trivial problem&lt;/strong&gt;; at the moment a lot of the little markers that show the position of trials are being drawn on top of each other - this is something I'll try to fix in the next release.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We Chose to go to the Moon</title>
      <published>2012-09-12T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2012-09-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;50 years ago today John F. Kennedy made a speech at Rice University committing the United States to a manned landing on the moon. At the time of the speech airplanes were about 60 years old and only 5 years previously, the first artificial satellite was put into orbit. Now it was apparently time to send humans to the moon - not to solve a problem, but because it might be possible. Here's my favourite part of the speech:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the striking fact that most of the scientists that the world has ever known are alive and working today, despite the fact that this Nation's own scientific manpower is doubling every 12 years in a rate of growth more than three times that of our population as a whole, despite that, the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension.&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;div class=&quot;breathe&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;730&quot; height=&quot;548&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/ouRbkBAOGEw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The audacity of it makes my head swim; the skills, infrastructures and technologies to do what Kennedy was proposing simply didn't exist. What did exist was an opponent, fear of nuclear annihilation at the hands of that opponent, and limitless resources. The success of the moon landing was a measure of what human ingenuity could achieve in a particularly scary geopolitical context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to think that humans are still capable of crazy schemes like this, maybe even without the need for the world to be divided in half. Maybe we just need to choose to go to Mars, and figure the rest out later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Day in September</title>
      <published>2012-09-11T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2012-09-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the 11th of September 2001 I helped my Dad move out of his office; a small unit in an industrial estate on the outskirts of Dublin, now the former home of his two-man company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His business partner had used the company like an ATM. The business faltered, then folded. We gathered what was left and loaded it into a borrowed white van; some tools, desks, a chair and a filing cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we drove away Joe Duffy was on the radio. It sounded like there had been a plane crash somewhere, or a disaster. Something had happened in New York and now listeners were calling in to the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped at a local pub and ordered soup and sandwiches. The small TV above the corner of the bar was showing news footage of a plane hitting a building. Later we'd discover that there were two more planes. The next day I watched a memorial service held in Dublin live on the television. I remember crying during one of the hymns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left Ireland on the 14th to visit my brother in Chicago. People had been stranded at Heathrow for days and were lining up to get on any flight leaving for the US.
I was accommodated on my scheduled flight. We ate food, we drank and enjoyed ourselves. The city was warm and quiet. The Sears Tower was closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, many years later, I live in New York. There is a sadness about the place today, more police at the train station, maybe a nervousness on the subway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about that day every year; about small things - the oddness of it all, the remnants in the back of the van and ham sandwiches. I think about my Dad, who has had to rebuild from scratch more than once. I think about how much I love him and I hope that he's doing okay.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I did the NYC Century yesterday; a 100 mile cycle around Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and The Bronx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set out from Central Park just after 6am, cruised down into Brooklyn and Prospect Park, then out to Coney Island, Breezy Point, the Rockaways, Forest Park, Little Neck, Flushing, Astoria, The Bronx, Harlem to the finish. The total distance was about 104 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Century was a great way to see parts of New York I would never ordinarily visit. The day has left me with an even greater appreciation for this wonderful city.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Happy Birthday Sneakers</title>

      <updated>2012-09-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;20 years ago today the film &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105435/&quot;&gt;Sneakers&lt;/a&gt; was released. It's one of my favourite films; I have watched it dozens of times. It's essentially a fun, nerdy B-movie caper with an A-list cast including Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, River Phoenix, Dan Aykroyd and Ben Kingsley. The story has a weight, simplicity and completeness that I find really satisfying. The score by James Horner really moves things along nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;730&quot; height=&quot;411&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/5m2Dnb2YLOk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
From Slate's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/features/2012/sneakers_20th_anniversary/robert_redford_sidney_poitier_and_ben_kingsley_made_one_very_prescient_movie_.html&quot;&gt;20th birthday article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For me, Sneakers occupies a special category: It’s a movie I can watch again and again and never get tired of; it’s the movie I happily settle on when every other DVD or download doesn’t quite suit my mood. I think I find it so trusty because it’s action-packed without being too violent, and smart without taking itself too seriously. And, perhaps most important, it’s perfectly paced: Even when you know every scene by heart, not one of them feels like it lasts a second longer than it needs to.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Sloan-Kettering Bone Marrow Transplant Project</title>
      <published>2012-07-07T00:00:00Z</published>
      <updated>2012-07-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;A write-up of my research and design project done in collaboration with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A research and design project done in collaboration with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to investigate the period of rehabilitation that follows a bone marrow transplant and then design improvements for patients and medical staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project features original research into the experience of a bone marrow transplant from the perspective of medical staff, administrative staff and transplant recipients. The findings from this research are grouped into six themes: The Patient’s Journey,&amp;nbsp; Symptoms, The Whole Patient, The Importance of the Caregiver, Informing Patients, Activity and Motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prototype web application based on these research findings was then developed; Activity App. Activity App builds on the capabilities of an off the shelf activity-monitoring/pedometer device, FitBit, to create a service that encourages bone marrow transplant patients to remain physically active before, during and after their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the development of the prototype, I worked with Sloan-Kettering to write a section of a protocol that will allow Activity App to be tested with patients as part of a forthcoming clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Presentation Video&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/42204358?color=f0d000&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;394&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While at ITP I've been fortunate enough to work on a number of health-related projects and I wanted to continue this work with my final thesis project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011 I approached Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York to see if we could collaborate on a project. MSKCC is one of the world's leading cancer hospitals. In 2011 MSKCC admitted over 23,000 patients, carried out 11,052 inpatient surgeries, carried out 8,181 outpatient surgeries, and conducted 1.18 million outpatient visits. The hospital also has a Design Innovation Group who work to improve procedures and patients' experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a number of discussions we saw that there was an opportunity for me to work on a project related to bone marrow transplantation; a procedure that is currently actively being investigated and improved at the hospital. We identified the period of rehabilitation following a bone marrow transplant as being of particular interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agreed that I would carry out a research and design project to improve patients' experience of bone marrow rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would &lt;strong&gt;carry out a period research&lt;/strong&gt; to investigate bone marrow transplantation as it's experienced today. I would then use the insights gained from this research to &lt;strong&gt;identify opportunities&lt;/strong&gt; to improve the patient experience. In the time remaining I would take one of these opportunities and &lt;strong&gt;develop a prototype of some kind&lt;/strong&gt;; a new service, device or application of some kind. I would take all of this work and &lt;strong&gt;present it&lt;/strong&gt; the hospital for them to take forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2012 I started working on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Research Phase&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research phase of the project lasted just under 6 weeks. I spent two weeks carrying out desk research; reading about bone marrow transplantation and related topics. I spent 4 weeks working on-site at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center conducting primary research. I carried out a number of in-hospital observations, visiting the locations in the hospital where bone marrow transplantation is carried out and observing staff at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the majority of my time at the hospital meeting and interviewing medical staff, administrators and patients. I interviewed 12 people in total; each interview followed a semi-structured format and was recorded, then transcribed. These interviews allowed me to develop a detailed understanding of the journey that patients go on when they undergo a bone marrow transplant - the people they interact with, the places they visit, the objects they interact with, the activities they carry out, the knowledge and skills they are expected to acquire and carry out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Findings&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I organized the findings of this research under a number of headings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Patient's Journey:&lt;/strong&gt; The experience of undergoing a bone marrow transplant is long and complicated. There are a number of different types of transplant offered depending on the patient's diagnosis, and while each type has its own set of attributes - no two transplants are identical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt; The symptoms experienced by bone marrow transplantation patients can be debilitating. The chemotherapy regimen causes patients to feel very weak and nauseous and these symptoms can prevent patients from carrying out simple daily tasks - standing, walking. The medicines being given to patients can be harmful to organs if the patient is not properly hydrated. Patients may experience impairments to their cognitive functions; attention and short term memory. After transplantation, patients may experience a range of complications e.g. infections, graft versus host disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Whole Patient: &lt;/strong&gt;Unsurprisingly, each person who needs to undergo a bone marrow transplant is a unique individual with specific personality traits, needs, fears, expectation, hobbies and relationships. All of these factors play a role in how the person will cope with treatment and rehabilitation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance of the Caregiver: &lt;/strong&gt;Other than the patient and the primary care physician, no other person plays a more significant role in the progress of the patient than their designated &amp;#8220;caregiver&amp;#8221;. The caregiver is typically a spouse, family-member or friend who remains on-hand throughout the patient's treatment and rehabilitation - this is a significant undertaking, especially when the caregiver needs to work or has other responsibilities. It would be fair to say that the caregiver is, in effect, co-opted onto the patient's medical team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Informing Patients: &lt;/strong&gt;Patients and caregivers receive/experience this large quantity of new information at a time when they are undergoing significant stress, and when the patient could be experiencing debilitating side affects related to their treatment. This information is not evenly distributed throughout the treatment journey, and they will be asked to make significant decisions based on this volume of new information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity &amp;amp; Motivation: &lt;/strong&gt; Physical activity plays a clinically important role in the patient's progress.&amp;nbsp; The reasons why patients should remain physically active change over time. Before the patient receives their chemotherapy and transplant they are advised to take exercise to condition themselves e.g. walking to build up strength and fitness before being admitted.&amp;nbsp; Once they enter the hospital, it's likely that they will spend some amount of time in confinement, and it's also likely that their symptoms will make physical activity difficult or unappealing. All patients are advised to remain physically active to minimize the extent to which they de-condition. After the patient leaves the hospital or confinement, it is important that they remain physically active to regain condition lost while in hospital/confinement. The more physically able the patient is, the more they are able to carry out day to day activities crucial to their wellbeing and survival. The less the patient is able to do, the less they will do - and their physical condition will deteriorate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had completed my research I investigated two design opportunities in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunity 1 - Informing the Patient: &lt;/strong&gt; I saw that there was an opportunity to re-design how useful, decision-critical information flows between the medical team, the patient and the caregiver. Rather than thinking about educating the patient using sets of materials, I proposed a way in which information could be offered through a service; experienced rather than given, staged over time, present when needed, discrete when not needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunity 2 - Activity &amp;amp; Motivation: &lt;/strong&gt; I saw that there was an opportunity to encourage patients to remain physically active throughout their entire journey. I proposed a way in which the hospital could begin to encourage physical activity long before the patient undergoes treatment. This approach/service would follow the patient during their treatment and rehabilitation; persuading them to take small amounts of regular exercise. It would give medical staff simple tools to offer feedback and encouragement to the patient; helping to keep them motivated as they return to health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Prototyping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the project was devoted to responding to one of these opportunities. I chose to develop a prototype of a service that could encourage patients to remain physically active before, during and after their transplant. I called this activity and motivation service &lt;i&gt;Activity App&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients using Activity App are offered a small, off the shelf pedometer in the very early stages of their treatment. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/7522612082/&quot; title=&quot;fitbit_paulmay_thesis by paulmmay, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8154/7522612082_d8ee2ff133_c.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;fitbit_paulmay_thesis&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pedometer is paired with a web application, Activity App. Activity App offers a simple view of the patient's level of physical activity without distractions and inappropriate game mechanics, options and features. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/7522582918/&quot; title=&quot;screenshot_profile_1 by paulmmay, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8290/7522582918_c36a6143ab_c.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot_profile_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with a therapist, patients set a daily activity goal. Each day they will receive a prompt via SMS reminding them of their goal. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/7522585856/&quot; title=&quot;inboundmessage_paulmay_thesis by paulmmay, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7117/7522585856_1955d3bcd9_c.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;inboundmessage_paulmay_thesis&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each day, patients respond to their reminder SMS rating how difficult they found yesterday's activity. This gives medical staff vital, subjective information about the patients ability to remain active. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/7522587992/&quot; title=&quot;smsreply_paulmay_thesis by paulmmay, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8422/7522587992_28b3c03997_c.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;smsreply_paulmay_thesis&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical staff have access to a dashboard showing how their patient population is doing. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/7522582284/&quot; title=&quot;screenshot_dashboard by paulmmay, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7248/7522582284_0e579fd7c3_c.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot_dashboard&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical staff have some simple tools to offer encouragement to patients. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulmmay/7522582556/&quot; title=&quot;screenshot_feedback by paulmmay, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7267/7522582556_e92d49d272_c.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot_feedback&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, rather than recommending physical activity to patients at different times and in different ways - MSKCC can offer a simple service that follows a patient throughout their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service allows patients and therapists to work together to set a goal, and rather than expecting the patient to be active, the service expects them to be inactive - and offers a &amp;#8220;hot trigger&amp;#8221; in the form of a daily SMS that encourages them to be active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients can monitor their own progress and can offer simple, subjective feedback. Because patients find feedback from medical staff highly motivating, medical staff have some simple tools they can use to offer encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity App is a fully working prototype, written in Sinatra and deployed to Heroku. I have released the source code to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center under an MIT License for them to continue its development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented my thesis project to the ITP community and representatives of MSKCC's Design Innovation Group in May of 2012 - completing the requirements for my Master's degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the project I was asked to write a section of a &lt;strong&gt;clinical trial protocol &lt;/strong&gt;that would allow Activity App to be used in a forthcoming clinical trial involving a particular population of bone marrow transplant patients. and so if the hospital are happy that Activity App is stable and secure enough to be used in a real world context, it can be. This is a really exciting prospect for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have completed a full write-up of the project, including a set of recommendations about how Activity App could be developed further, and delivered this write-up to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. I would love to continue to collaborate them in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Future Scenarios&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am very happy with the work I did in such a short period of time. It would now be desirable for Activity App to be tested with real patients and medical staff. During this test a small group of patients would be offered the service at the beginning of their treatment. They would use the service, and offer feedback at set intervals. This feedback could be implemented as it was given by patients, or it could be aggregated and addressed at the end of the test. I have worked with Memorial Sloan-Kettering to write a section of a clinical trial document that would allow Activity App to be tested in such a way, and I hope that this happens in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also be very keen to see this type of service rolled out to all patients at the hospital. It may become standard practice for medical staff to recommend a period of conditioning/activity to all patients in advance of their treatment. If this was the case, then offering a service like Activity App could help to support patients’ motivation while offering medical staff insight into patient behavior. Over time, the ways in which patients are supported in the use of these types of persuasive systems could be refined and tested further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s my belief that the integration of physical activity in a medical context, supported by simple technologies like Activity App, can improve clinical outcomes – obviously this is something that should be carefully considered, introduced slowly and evaluated over time. It’s an exciting challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing I learned from this project was that I am highly motivated and produce good work when I can work reasonably independently on projects that are personally meaningful to me. My challenge now is to make or shape an environment that allows me to work in this way most or all of the time; it’s likely that I will start or help co-found some sort of company/venture that takes on difficult challanges at the intersection of humanity and technology and seeks to measurably improve people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the project was incredibly motivating, I must also recognize that working  independently on a challenging project, especially one to human health, can be lonely and stressful at times. I had no contact with upsetting situations while carrying out research at MSKCC, but I underestimated how much I would be affected by the topic itself, the language, the enormity of the challenge facing medical staff and patients. This context, combined with a very challenging schedule in the early phases of the project, weighed on me. If and when I do a project related to human health in the future I will be sure to consider the impact of the subject matter on my emotional well being and mental health and I will put measures in place to ensure that I have proper support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Process&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am satisfied that the methods I selected to undertake this project were, for the most part, appropriate and useful. The decision to adhere to a reasonably detailed project structure allowed me to spend the majority of my time researching, learning, interacting with people, documenting my work and producing software. I spent relatively little time during the project on planning or task management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While each phase of the project was completed on time, or within an acceptable margin, I see now that this was in-part due to my willingness to scale the amount of work I did in each phase. I could have spent more time in each phase – interviewing more people, adding more functionality – but chose not to. I had never really reflected properly on the relationship between the attitude of a project (doing enough things well, rather than doing as many things as possible) and its outcome. I take heart in this and will continue to develop my skills and understanding of project planning and pre-production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Research&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Conducting a period of secondary research was very useful. In a short period of time I became familiar with the basic facts, processes and vocabularly associated with bone marrow transplantation. Without this knowledge I wouldn’t have been able to ask meaningful questions when it came time to do interviews.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect I feel as though my secondary research could have been improved; all the materials I read didn’t fit closely enough with my research questions, and I could have made better use of my time if they had – I would have been able to read more deeply in a smaller number of areas. If I was to do this project again I would establish a much closer link between my research questions, a set of topics related to those questions and a set of materials related to each topic. I would consult with experts who could recommend materials to me. I would work with a reference librarian to help me find materials closely aligned with my research questions, and I would read deeply on those topics. I need to improve my secondary research skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The observation exercises were useful and produced useful photographs and notes. While carrying out the observations I felt uncomfortable and out of place and my interactions with people felt forced and shallow – I need to practice these skills so that I am more used to the being an outsider, being in the moment while gathering useful information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrying out semi-structured interviews resulted in a wealth of detailed, useful information and allowed me to get to know the people who are involved in the delivery of care. I drew heavily on the information gathered during these interviews later in the project, and the empathy I developed for the people at MSKCC helped me make good decisions when it came to developing my ideas and software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve carried out research interviews many times in the past, I found these interviews to be very challenging – the subject matter was complex and there was no real opportunity for people to be re-interviewed; it was important that each interview went well. If I was to do the interviews again I think I would reduce the number of questions significantly and tailor each interview more closely to the interviewee – I could have asked fewer, better questions and allowed the conversation to flow more naturally; in a sense I need to think of interviews as structured conversations rather than interviews where the person has information and my questions are tools to prompt them to give me that information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the volume of information created during interviews became something of a problem in itself. From a purely practical point of view, transcribing interviews is tedious. I could have used a commercial service to do the transcriptions, but felt as though there was merit in “sitting-with” and re-listening to interviews; transcribing them myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now sure that, given the short amount of time available in the research phase, having the interviews transcribed by sombody would have been a better approach. I would have had more time to do other work, and once the interviews had been transcribed I would have had more time to reflect on the things people were saying. I will take this approach on my next project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Prototyping, Production&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The prototyping and production phases of the project ran reasonably smoothly. Once I had described the practical project I wanted to work on I went a level deeper to describe the things I wanted users to be able to do. I used post-it notes to break “stories” (e.g. the user logs in for the first time) down into individual steps and supporting functions (e.g. the user must be able to pair their fitbit with my software). This system was simple and effective and one I’ll use again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production of the software itself was highly iterative; I released code to the production server over 140 times in the 4 week prototyping phase. I was able to do this because I was using the domain specific language Sinatra and the hosting provider Heroku. This system allowed me to write code on my laptop and issue a single command to release code to the production server. Using live data from my FitBit and testing with two volunteers allowed me to test that each of these small releases worked and improved the user experience.&amp;nbsp; I’ll be sure to bring this approach forward with me; when I develop software it really matters to me that I’m using real data. It’s important that my tools help me, rather than getting in the way – I am just not interested in configuring servers, so a system like Heroku is perfect for me. Being able to work locally and push to a remote server means that I’m able to see my changes almost instantly. This process was really groundbreaking for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Presentation, Documentation&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am glad that I gave myself a specific window of time in the project to document and present my work. I didn’t, however, leave myself enough time to document my work as I went along. I should have had one day per week, or one week in the middle of the project when I drew togehter all my materials into some sort of collection. Doing this would have made my final documentation more of a compilation exercise, rather than a separate act of documentation. This is something I’m still thinking about – but on my next project I’ll consider whether more “real-time” documentation would be useful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Thanks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I owe a sincere debt of gratitude to the staff of Memorial Sloan-Kettering's Design Innovation team for their support and guidance throughout this project. I would particularly like to thank Era Bani who acted as my liaison at the hospital and made sure that I had access to people, facilities and information vital to my project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am incredibly grateful to patients, doctors, nurses, therapists and administrators at Sloan-Kettering who, though busy with far more serious matters, agreed to be interviewed and provide feedback during the course of the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank all the staff and students at ITP for their support. I particularly want to thank Nancy Hechinger for her trust, patience and straight-talk. Steven Dean made the initial introduction to MSKCC and instructed me in the design of health-related applications. Steven Klise offered technical help and sound advice while I was developing the prototype of Activity App.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
