        <p><strong>We've started a knowledge base for the ITP community.</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://sklise.s3.amazonaws.com/itp/20111120-itpqabeta.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>ITP is a two year graduate program nestled somewhere in between the arts and the cutting-edge of technology. We use a few email lists to keep in touch with the community. There's the informal Student list for questions, memes, flamewars, suggestions, announcements. There's the ICM list for help with Processing and other programming questions. And the PhysComp list for physical computing questions. There's also an Alumni list. Four individual email lists all with one main problem, the ability to search back before your time on the list. This is an issue for all the perennial questions like "How do I actually make an LED blink?" and "Where is the best place around NYU to take a nap?" As well as that one former student or faculty member that answered your question years ago but is no longer on the listserve.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.itpqa.com">ITPQA</a>, a Stack Overflow inspired question and answer site for ITP. After just one week of use we've had questions from current students and alumni and answers likewise as well as some faculty offering answers.</p>

<p>Go ahead, <a href="http://www.itpqa.com/register">sign up</a> for an account and start asking and answering questions. And don't forget to vote up (or down) the questions and answers that are helpful to you. The site works on a system of reputation, reputation created by the other users on the site.</p>

<h4>The Background</h4>

<p>The seeds of this project started a year ago when <a href="http://alexdodge.com/">Alex Dodge</a>, <a href="http://paulmay.org/">Paul May</a>, <a href="http://iamspikemccue.com/">Spike McCue</a> and I sat down as doe-eyed first years and came up with an ambitious project to revolutionize the way that ITP students interact and share information on the internet. We came up with a codename and a planâ€¦and then got consumed by our other work.</p>

<p>Then this year Alex and I returned to our quest, though vastly scaled back. This conversation resulted in Alex building small sign-up sites for <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/tno/">TNO</a>, <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/driveby/">DriveBys</a> and <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/theoryclub/">Theory Club</a>. Sign up and scheduling for these events has been liberated from the inbox as well as an archive for the previous meetings.</p>

<p>Finally, in the aftermath of a heated discussion on the Student List about the list itself I talked to <a href="http://benturner.com/">Ben Turner</a> and we decided it was time to stop complaining or making plans and to actually put something up.</p>

<p>We've expanded the team a bit already with some students, including <a href="http://www.mlmckenna.com/">Margaret McKenna</a>, more skilled at PHP than I am.</p>

<h4>Roadmap</h4>

<p>Aside from bug fixes the main feature we hope to introduce to ITPQA is integration with the email lists. Questions tagged with "PhysComp" or "ICM" will soon automate emails to those lists. And soon writing an email to the Student list with "[ITPQA]" in the subject line will post that email to the site.</p>

<h4>The Tech Specs</h4>

<p>ITPQA is built on <a href="https://github.com/Datawalke/Coordino">Coordino</a> and hosted on <a href="https://phpfog.com/">PHP Fog</a>. The source code is on <a href="http://github.com/stevenklise/itpqa">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Above is a video of the Tapper Sequencer. I made it for the midterm assignment in <a href="/Musical-Sequence">Musical Sequence</a>, it built around an Arduino. I'm happy to say that the Tapper can operate without the aid of a computer and has an 1/8" line-out jack to hook in to whatever sound system you so desire. So the Tapper can be patched in to other effects pedals and amps and stand alone as it's own music maker, though it is very primitive and made of cardboard.</p>

<p>There are eight steps to the sequence, with the pitch of each set by a potentiometer. The potentiometer is divided invisibly into 12 steps designed so that all the notes are in tune relative to each other. It would be better if each of the 12 steps was demarcated either through using rotary encoders instead of potentiometers or even lines on the case. There is a five-way switch that shifts the notes up and down a total of five octaves.</p>

<p>The illuminated red button resets the sequence when pressed. So if the 4th note just played and the red button is pressed the next note is the first note. The button above the red one reverses the sequence and while the sequence is running backwards this button is illuminated green. The other two buttons on this pad are currently not working.</p>

<p>For the final I'm hoping to take this basic design and add a lot more functionality and put the sequencer in a less-cardboard box.</p>

    </hgroup>
    <div class="article-body">
        <p>After a summer and fall of slowly rewriting this site in Ruby on Rails I realized that a Rails app is overkill. That and that I actually prefer the command line and text editor to any web form.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>It's a static site generator written in Ruby. No database. No browser interface. I write my posts in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and have a handful of template files. Running Jekyll (<code>$ jekyll</code>) combines the templates with the posts and generates html files of the site. Very little server load, simple. Easy to update. No bloat or complicated (and largely unneeded) Wordpress upgrades.</p>

<p>However I've been disappointed with the lack of detailed documentation for setting up Jekyll. I'll write a bit here how I set up comments and an RSS feed and soon I'll write up creating and deploying a site with Jekyll.</p>

<h2>Comments with Disqus</h2>

<p>For commenting, without a database, I had to look for a service that could embed in the page and save the comments on an external database. Embeddable commenting is exactly what <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> does. Getting Disqus on my site was wonderfully easy and straight forward. I found a tutorial by Douglas Creager who explains the whole process on <a href="http://dcreager.net/2009/08/07/disqus-comments/">his own Jekyll site</a>. So I've got Disqus comments, just like over on my <a href="http://stevenklise.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, so please use it.</p>

<h2>Burning an RSS Feed</h2>

<p>Even though Google Reader has just crippled itself I still prefer to digest the internet through RSS feeds. With Jekyll's templating building a feed was also easy and took 5 minutes to set up. Five minutes if you remove the time spent chasing character encoding issues from copying posts from Wordpress. I found a <a href="http://recursive-design.com/blog/2010/09/14/integrating-jekyll-with-feedburner/">tutorial</a> from Recursive Design to create a feed and then the one step process of getting that feed hosted on Feedburner.</p>

<p>Straightforward until the author started talking about nginx rewrites. There is some code offered to make a rewrite but no indication where that code goes. If you're familiar with nginx you probably knew exactly how to do this, but I don't. This site is hosted on Heroku so a rewrite would not be able to be applied directly to the server and would have to be app specific. Jekyll on Heroku requires the <code>rack-jekyll</code> gem (<a href="https://github.com/bry4n/rack-jekyll">documentation on Github</a>). Running on Rack gives quick access to rewrites in just four lines. Open up <code>config.ru</code> (a full tutorial on Jekyll is coming soon, on this blog) and add the following lines:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1340812.js?file=config.ru"></script>


<p>You'll also need to include <code>rack/rewrite</code> in your <code>Gemfile</code> or <code>.gems</code>. I went with bundler and a <code>Gemfile</code> which you can see below</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1340812.js?file=Gemfile"></script>


<p>So far, blogging with Jekyll has been great.</p>
