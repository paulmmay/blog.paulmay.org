        <p>The midterm assignment for <a href="/Musical-Sequence">Musical Sequence</a> was to build a sequencer using an Arduino. Here are two images of what I built. It's an eight step sequencer currently with a reset button and a reverse mode. No computer is necessary to operate, and there is a 1/8" audio out jack in the back of the box. Video and a more detailed write up are coming.</p>

        <p><strong>Playing a multiplayer game through Telnet with Sinatra &amp; a daemon.</strong></p>

<p>For our first 'make something' assignment in <a href="/Understanding-Networks">Understanding Networks</a> we were tasked with creating a client for a Telnet server to play a game <a href="https://github.com/tigoe/MakingThingsTalk2/tree/master/chapter2/project2/MonskiPong">similar to pong</a>.</p>

<p>The class is taught in PHP, a fact which has convinced me to do (and someday document how to do) everything in Ruby. Of course Telnet is a persistent connection and HTTP is stateless. Trying to maintain a Telnet connection strictly through a browser is then not possible without diving into the world of sockets and streaming.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1257779.js?file=daemon.rb"></script>


<p>To maintain the browser as the interface but not have <code>telnet</code> happening in the HTTP requests I wrote, with the help of resident Greg Borenstein, a daemon. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing">daemon</a>) is a script that runs in the background, constantly. In my case the daemon listens to the database for a new Task. When it finds a new Task it sends the contents of the Task to the Telnet connection and then marks the Task as completed.</p>

<p>The Task is a DataMapper object.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1257779.js?file=Task.rb"></script>


<p>The user clicks an arrow or connection button in the browser and a Task object is created with that command and designated as not being done. In the end this worked well, however the latency between browser to database to daemon to telnet server was only manageable running the app locally.</p>

        <p><strong>Clumpers is an experiment of combining flocking behaviors with cellular automaton like rules without discrete boundaries between organisms</strong></p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/23694777?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="772" height="433" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>My intention with Clumpers was to see what would happen when a cellular automaton was moved from a discrete grid to a continuous plane and allow the organisms to move around. What emergent qualities would result by combining two complex systems?</p>

<p>The program start with a few hundred organisms spawning at random throughout the screen. Each individual organism then looks for the average position of all the organisms, as well as the average heading of the organisms within a smaller neighborhood. These two values are scaled and combined to a desired velocity. A small random vector is summed to the velocities each frame to encourage movement.</p>

<p>At the same time as these steering behaviors, each organism is counting the number of neighbors it has. IF that number is above a "crowded" threshold or below a "loneliness" threshold the organism dies. Upon death the organism leaves behind a ripple and is reborn at a random location on screen. My original intention was to have organisms born in locations based on the density of living organisms, however without clear boundaries between organisms it proved difficult to get a global density map.</p>

<p>The specifications for the final in Reading &amp; Writing Electronic Text were to perform a text generated by a Python program. My previous homeworks are not well suited to reading aloud, on these I focused mostly on structure and form and not readability.</p>

<p><em>Last Accessed / Last Modified</em> is an attempt at having a computer communicate its ability to perceive its surroundings with a human reader through a poem. So what is a poem to a computer? What methods in Python are 'poetic'? In my mind it's recursion and the <code>random()</code> function. In recursion there is refrain, the block of code runs over and over, but also there is self-reference, each time a recursive method runs its input is the previous run's output. As for randomness, every action a computer performs is specified by a human, thus the only real choice a computer has is what number to spit out when prompted with <code>random()</code>. Neither of these two methods make a computer truly expressive but until a computer becomes self aware I think these are good approximations.</p>

<p>With those methods chosen, what will the program write? Information about the Python file itself as well as the current state of the computer seemed an obvious first step. The poem begins with an introduction, chosen from a context free grammar like process though the words in use are chosen to always result in a similar attitude of greeting. The computer will tell the reader when the file was last accessed and how long the computer has been awake, as well as a 'guess' of sorts to how long the poem might be.</p>

<p>After the introduction, the computer chooses a candidate zip code from a text file and checks the candidate against a predefined zip code of the current location. If the two zips do not match a comment on the current weather at the proposed zip code is printed and the function runs again and again until the correct zip code is chosen. The time of sunset at the current location ends the poem.</p>

<p><em>Last Accessed / Last Modified</em> is all artifice. It is human written code crafted to create output to illicit a computer's poetics. That it is impossible to have a computer write its own poetry is a logical conclusion though in my mind does not detract from the poems this program creates.</p>
