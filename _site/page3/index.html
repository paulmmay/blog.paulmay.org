<p>The specifications for the final in Reading &amp; Writing Electronic Text were to perform a text generated by a Python program. My previous homeworks are not well suited to reading aloud, on these I focused mostly on structure and form and not readability.</p>

<p><em>Last Accessed / Last Modified</em> is an attempt at having a computer communicate its ability to perceive its surroundings with a human reader through a poem. So what is a poem to a computer? What methods in Python are 'poetic'? In my mind it's recursion and the <code>random()</code> function. In recursion there is refrain, the block of code runs over and over, but also there is self-reference, each time a recursive method runs its input is the previous run's output. As for randomness, every action a computer performs is specified by a human, thus the only real choice a computer has is what number to spit out when prompted with <code>random()</code>. Neither of these two methods make a computer truly expressive but until a computer becomes self aware I think these are good approximations.</p>

<p>With those methods chosen, what will the program write? Information about the Python file itself as well as the current state of the computer seemed an obvious first step. The poem begins with an introduction, chosen from a context free grammar like process though the words in use are chosen to always result in a similar attitude of greeting. The computer will tell the reader when the file was last accessed and how long the computer has been awake, as well as a 'guess' of sorts to how long the poem might be.</p>

<p>After the introduction, the computer chooses a candidate zip code from a text file and checks the candidate against a predefined zip code of the current location. If the two zips do not match a comment on the current weather at the proposed zip code is printed and the function runs again and again until the correct zip code is chosen. The time of sunset at the current location ends the poem.</p>

<p><em>Last Accessed / Last Modified</em> is all artifice. It is human written code crafted to create output to illicit a computer's poetics. That it is impossible to have a computer write its own poetry is a logical conclusion though in my mind does not detract from the poems this program creates.</p>

<p>This assignment for PComp was to create a “stupid pet trick” by taking all the skills we have learned thus far in the labs and create something amusing or engaging. Continuing the theme of the ball sink game I made in Procressing I decided to take the same primitive game and add sensors, a servo and a score board.</p>

<p>The player tilts the board rolling the ball into the hole which decreases the readings on a photocell to below a certain threshold, and then the Arduino turns a servo 90 degrees to knock the ball out of the hole. Upon each score the 7-segment LED updates. A reset button was added in to restart the score board without needing to hit the main reset button built in to the Arduino.</p>

<p>I built the circuit entirely on a breadboard and wrote the code before starting on fabrication to be sure that if errors happened they could be isolated to the building process. And almost immediately the scroll saw proved unwieldy for cutting a perfect circle in the masonite. As a result the ping pong ball doesn’t always block the proper amount of light to trigger the photocell. If I were to make a Version2 of this I’d make the ball conductive and have to leads along the edge of the hole to prevent false triggers by low ambient light or no triggers from too much. I would also exchange the servo with a solenoid as currently the ball always gets pushed in the same direction but a solenoid would pop the ball straight up adding a variety to which direction it would go on a reset.</p>
