<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>Founded in 1884, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) is a private, not-for-profit cancer treatment and research hospital based in New York. In 2011, the year preceding this project, MSKCC admitted over 23,000 patients, carried out 11,052 inpatient surgeries, carried out 8,181 outpatient surgeries, and conducted 1.18 million outpatient visits. MSKCC is currently ranked #2 for cancer care in the United States, and is at the absolute forefront of cancer research globally.</p>

<h3 id="project-background">Project Background</h3>

<p>One of the most aggressive forms of cancer treatment is a stem cell transplant, also known as a bone marrow transplant. Stem cell transplants are used to treat leukemias and cancers that affect the body’s ability to make new blood and immune cells.</p>

<p>In a stem cell transplant, the patient is first given ultra high-dose chemotherapy which has the effect of killing the patient’s own bone marrow and their ability to make healthy stem cells. The patient then receives donor stem cells. Over time, these cells migrate to the long bones of the body, and start to make new blood and immune cells.</p>

<p>The process of undergoing a stem cell transplant is incredibly onerous. In the period after the transplant the patient is left with no functioning immune system, and so infection is a real risk. They are also left physically debilitated, and in need of prolonged rehabilitation.</p>

<h3 id="ux-research-mandate">UX Research Mandate</h3>

<p>I was asked to support MSKCC’s Design and Innovation Group by conducting user experience research into stem cell transplantation. In particular, I would uncover insights that could inform the design of new technologies to support patients rehabilitating after stem cell transplantation.</p>

<h3 id="ux-research-planning">UX Research Planning</h3>

<p>I developed a detailed research plan describing primary and secondary research questions, described all key methods - and crucially - described how I would protect patient and stakeholder confidentiality throughout the process. This research plan was approved via internal MSKCC processes, which allowed me to begin my research.</p>

<p>Research questions included:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Patient Need:</strong> What is a stem cell transplant and why would one be required?</li>
  <li>Why is a period of rehabilitation required?</li>
  <li>What is the patient’s experience of rehabilitation?</li>
  <li>How does MSKCC support patients throughout rehabilitation?</li>
  <li>What aspects of the rehabilitation process could be improved upon and what would the impact of these improvements be?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ux-research-process">UX Research Process</h3>

<p>UX Research Phases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Research outline &amp; pitch to MSK stakeholders</li>
  <li>Research planning, data security, patient safety and approvals process</li>
  <li>Literature review into stem cell transplantation &amp; rehabilitation</li>
  <li>8 weeks of in-person research using various methods</li>
  <li>Research synthesis &amp; insight development in collaboration with the MSKCC team</li>
  <li>Description of design opportunities, specifically related to the use of apps and services to support rehabilitation</li>
  <li>Articulation of app design principles</li>
  <li>Rapid prototyping of a web application demonstrating key design principles</li>
  <li>Presentation &amp; handoff of work to internal design teams</li>
</ul>

<p>Data Gathering Methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Literature review using journal databases.</li>
  <li>Participant observation at hospital facilities. Shadowing of patients and clinicians. Documented using audio recordings, stills photography.</li>
  <li>Semi-structured interviews with clinicians. Documented using audio recordings, then transcribed</li>
  <li>Proxemics/Description of key spaces and environments. Documented via stills photography and accompanying notes.</li>
  <li>Semi-structured interviews in patients at various stages of transplant process; before, directly after, in rehabilitation. Documented using audio recordings, then transcribed</li>
</ul>

<p>Data Analysis &amp; Synthesis Methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Analysis of literature review, interview transcripts, observations for common topics/themes.</li>
  <li>Affinity mapping/spatial grouping of common themes.</li>
  <li>Development of driving insights/design mandates stemming from key topics/themes.</li>
  <li>Development of an experience journey framework describing the stem cell transplant journey, and common variations/pathways.</li>
  <li>Development of personas describing common patient types; “Engaged, Slow and Steady”, “Engaged, Pushing”, “Disengaged, Unsure”, “Disengaged, Dejected” etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sample-insights--ux-mandates">Sample Insights / UX Mandates</h3>

<p>From the synthesis activities, I developed a small set of insights and design mandates/principles which could apply to an app designed to support stem cell patients. These insights included:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Physical activity plays a clinically important role in the patient’s progress after a bone marrow transplant.</strong> The more physically able the patient is, the more they are able to carry out day to day activities. The less the patient is able to do, the less they will do - and their physical condition will deteriorate.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mandate:</strong> The app should stress the importance of physical activity to the patient’s overall recovery.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>More is not necessarily better.</strong> It’s crucial that the patient proceeds with their rehabilitation at a safe pace. Over-reaching can result in setbacks for the patient. A small number of specific lab values, such as white blood cell count, act as markers of the patients physical recovery, and rehabilitation should really mirror the progression in these positive lab values.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mandate:</strong> The rehabilitation programme needs to be specific to the patient, and ideally should be mapped to critical lab values. The app should expect the patient’s progress to be non-linear.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Most patients undergoing rehabilitation were highly motivated to please to their primary physician</strong>. The patient’s transplant is overseen by one senior oncologist, and for the patient, this doctor is the “face” of their treatment experience. Patients felt pride when they made progress, and were highly motivated by praise/encouragement from the primary physician.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mandate:</strong> Positive/motivating feedback from the physician should form part of the app’s design.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="project-results">Project Results</h3>

<p>All design deliverables were passed to MSK at the end of the project, along with a working web application expressing UX mandates and demonstrating key user flows.</p>

<h3 id="project-challenges">Project Challenges</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gaining access to MSKCC physicians and key stakeholders</li>
  <li>Interacting with stem cell transplantation patients without compromising their health or wellbeing</li>
  <li>Protecting patient confidentiality &amp; treating data sensitively</li>
</ul>
