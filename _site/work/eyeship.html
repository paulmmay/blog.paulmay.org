		<p><strong>Developed as my undergraduate thesis project with Tim Twomey, EyeShip was a remotely piloted airship that captured TV quality video and sensor data, relayed that content to a ground station. The ground station then streamed this content live on the web.</strong></p>
		
		<p>Our goal with this project was to demonstrate an alternative approach to traditional aerial camerawork - usually done with cranes and booms.</p>

<p>We developed EyeShip, a highly capable aerial camera platform and ground station. Eyeship featured a high quality camera and video transmitter for the core video applications. It also featured a small onboard computer, sensor package and packet radio system that could send altitude and other useful data back to the ground station.</p>

<p>In the intervening years, autonomous drones, and remotely piloted vehicles like EyeShip have become widely available and we are proud to have been somewhat ahead of that trend.</p>
