<p class="project-summary">I spent four months working with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to understand the informational needs of stem cell transplant patients and their families. I proposed and prototyped a new service to help these patients manage the significant amount of information they encounter throughout this complex medical procedure.</p>
<div class="project-description"><p>Bone marrow transplantation (also called <a href="http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/scireport/pages/chapter5.aspx">stem cell</a> transplantation) is a complex medical procedure used to treat cancers of the blood and bone. Patients receive high dose chemotherapy to kill the cancer in their body. This treatment also eliminates their ability to make blood and fight infections. Patients are given an infusion of stem cells, their transplant, and over time new blood starts to be produced. The immune system begins rebuilds slowly.</p>

<p>While undergoing a transplant, patients need to understand both their disease and treatment, so that they can make informed decisions. Patients' families need to know how they can provide practical and emotional support. The transplant can be as much about the management of information as it is about physical endurance.</p>

<p>I carried out careful research into the ways that patients and their families learn about stem cell transplantation. This work involved:</p>

<ul>
<li>Analyzing the educational content offered to patients by the hospital (conversations, books, pamphlets, legal documents)</li>
<li>Interviewing patients and their families</li>
<li>Interviewing doctors, nurses, therapists, and social workers</li>
<li>Visiting and observing medical facilities</li>
<li>Facilitating workshops</li>
<li>Presenting crisp, timely summaries of research to MSKCC staff</li>
</ul>


<p>I wrote up and presented the key insights from this research, then developed a set of design principles that would help inform future projects.</p>

<p>Informed by these design principles, I proposed that MSKCC should build a new service to help stem cell transplant patient manage the information associated with their treatment.</p>

<p>I developed a prototype of one key part of this service; a web application that offers educational content to patients and their families based on their specific medical circumstances and learning preferences.</p>

<p>The project was presented to senior medical staff in September 2012. Reaction to the project was very positive, and the hospital are now considering implementing the service in full. My collaborator on this project was the very talented <a href="http://http://galinaryb.wordpress.com/">Galina Rybatsky</a>.</p>
