		<div class="left content">
		<p><strong>In 2003 I worked with Kevin Cannon to build a system that allowed a user to accurately control a computer using the motion of his/her hands. This system was called Physical Motion Interface (PMI) and was designed to enable expressive, gestural control of a computer using cheaply available parts. We completed the project in under 6 weeks, and demonstrated PMI more than three years before the introduction of Nintendo's Wiimote; the first mass-market gestural interface.</strong></p>
		
		<p>PMI used a webcam to track the position of two LEDs on an interface glove, translating the position of those LEDs into six recognisable gestures.</p>

<p>In our demonstration software, six gestures were tied to the control of a video player - by gesturing right and left the video would play, fast forward, pause, rewind. Gesturing up and down controlled audio volume.</p>

<p>I was responsible for implementing the image tracking and gesture recognition. Kevin Cannon designed, prototyped and developed the interface glove.</p>

<figcaption>The system used an off-the-shelf webcam and custom software to track and LED embedded in a glove. This approach proved to be robust, and allowed for accurate gesture tracking, and assigment of gestures to computer controls.</figcaption>
