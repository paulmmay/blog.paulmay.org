## About
Hello, my name is Paul May and I'm a researcher and designer from Dublin, Ireland - currently living and working in New York. 

My work is focused on the design of experiences that require fluid interaction between people and computers. It's my belief that by putting human needs at the center design, we can offer coherent, emotional and satisfying experiences.

Typically my projects begin with a broad context or a loosely defined problem. I carry out research (reading, analyzing data, speaking to people, observing) to try to define the project further. I then express what I've learned through documentation and a prototype of some kind, before testing that prototype. Most projects involve multiple iterations like this - defining questions, carrying out research, making prototypes, testing. I enjoy working in this way. 

I have worked on projects for many companies and organisations including:

* Abbey Theatre
* Accenture
* Barracuda FX
* BBC
* Carte Blanche Greetings
* Comcast Corporation
* Frog Design
* Microsoft

Recently I graduated from NYU's Interactive Telecommunication Program (ITP) which I attended as a Fulbright winner. My time at ITP allowed me to design and explore as part of a wonderfully creative community.  

In my spare time I enjoy the sport of triathlon, photography, writing and cooking.
