title: About
---
Hello, my name is Paul May and I'm a researcher and multi-disciplinary designer from Dublin, Ireland - currently living and working in New York. I recently graduated from NYU's <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu">Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP)</a> which I attended as a Fulbright winner.

### Work
<p class="noindent">I research, design and make interactive products, services and environments. I am particularly interested in projects related to:</p>

* Health and human activity
* Government and civic society
* Media production, manipulation and sharing

### Process
<p class="noindent">My projects typically begin with a loosely defined problem or a context. I define the project further through research (reading, analyzing data, speaking to people, observing), before expressing what I've learned through a prototype and a series of tests.</p>

### Clients
<p class="noindent">I have worked on projects for many organisations including Abbey Theatre, Accenture, Barracuda FX, BBC, Carte Blanche Greetings, Comcast Corporation, Frog Design, Front, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Microsoft and TouchTunes.</p>
