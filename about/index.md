## About
Hello, my name is Paul May and I'm a researcher and multi-disciplinary designer from Dublin, Ireland - currently living and working in New York. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:webmail@paulmay.org">webmail@paulmay.org</a>. 

### Work, Process
My work is focused on the design of satisfying and useful experiences that require fluid interaction between people and computers over time.

Typically my projects begin loosely defined problem or context. I carry out research to define the project further (by reading, analyzing data, speaking to people, observing), before expressing what I've learned through a prototype (content, software, hardware, service) and a series of tests. Most projects involve multiple iterations like this. 

I am particularly interested in projects that relate to:

* Health and human activity
* Government and civic society
* Media production, manipulation and sharing

I have worked on projects for many organisations including:

* Abbey Theatre
* Accenture
* Barracuda FX
* BBC
* Carte Blanche Greetings
* Comcast Corporation
* Frog Design
* Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
* Microsoft
* TouchTunes

I recently graduated from NYU's <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu">Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP)</a> which I attended as a Fulbright winner. My time at ITP allowed me to design and explore as part of a wonderfully creative community.

### Not Work
Outside of my work I enjoy the sport of triathlon (swimming, cycling and running), photography, writing and cooking.
