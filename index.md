Ohio raised and currently residing and coding in Brooklyn. I graduated from
[ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu) in May and will start as a resident research there in
August. I make things with code with the goal of keeping people at their
computers just long enough to learn something and then get back in to the real
world...or to make jokes.
