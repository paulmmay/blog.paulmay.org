Ohio raised and currently residing and coding in Brooklyn. I am a Resident Researcher
at the [Interactive Telecommunications Program](http://itp.nyu.edu) and a freelance
web developer. I make things with code with the goal of keeping people at their
computers just long enough to learn something and then get back in to the real
world...or to make jokes.
