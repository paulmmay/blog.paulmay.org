[**True Cause I Read It On The Internet**](http://www.true-cause-i-read-it-on
-the-internet.net/) is a joke about the truth value of what we read online. I
read a lot of articles and blog posts on the internet each day and frequently
forget which stories were from which site. When I repeat something I've read
and want to add credence to it I normally tell my friends what my source is.
When I can't remember I say merely: "I read it on the internet," and somehow
that's enough.

But it's not enough, as evidenced in the [spread of a fake quote](http://www.th
eatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/05/anatomy-of-a-fake-quotation/238257/)
after the Osama Bin Laden was killed. So *True Cause...* lets visitors create
their own facts and gives the facts a peramanet spot on the internet, thus
making the fact 'true.' In this age of the internet it's easier than ever to
claim truth and harder and harder to figure out the real truth value.

Vistors to **True Cause** are shown some fact that another visitor created. To
create a new fact a visitor just types their fact to the right of the "/" in
the address bar. Visiting that URL will automatically add the fact to the
database, eternalizing its truth value.
