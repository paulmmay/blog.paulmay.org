Moving my blog to Jekyll so I can write using iA Writer. Work in progress.

### To-Do
* ~~Fix image alignment~~
* Make a non-photo image class
* Diagram class
* Use typecast to pick good h2 and h3
* ~~Check again on iPad~~
* Think about a way to step through blog articles, next, previous
*  ~~Get the basic blog up on Heroku to test~~
* ~~Start to think about /blog - multiple posts on one page~~
* Comments (long finger) 
* Class for videos
* Keep working on /about - edit ruthlessly
* Start to think about work/portfolio
* Switch DNS to point at Heroku
* Point old.paulmay.org at current host
* Dig out old articles from web archive (long finger)
