Moving my blog to Jekyll so I can write using iA Writer. Work in progress.

### To-Do
* ~~Start to think about work/portfolio~~
* Go back through older articles and check for janky formatting
* Make responsive ~~image and~~ video classes
* ~~Better h2, h3 and lists~~
* Make minibio responsive
* Think about sounds, other media
* Think about a way to step through blog articles, next, previous
*  ~~Get the basic blog up on Heroku to test~~
* ~~Start to think about /blog - multiple posts on one page~~
* ~~Fix image alignment~~
* Comments (long finger…maybe) 
* Layout for full screen processing sketches
* Start converting good processing work to processing.js
* ~~Keep working on /about - edit ruthlessly~~
* ~~Check again on iPad~~
* ~~Switch DNS to point at Heroku (new.paulmay.org pointing - yet to move main site)~~
* ~~Point old.paulmay.org at current host~~
* ~~Dig out old articles from web archive (long finger)~~
* ~~Dig out very, very old articles from web archive~~
* ~~Improve responsiveness, add viewport and better media queries per https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dkx3qtm_22dxsrgcf4~~
