Moving my blog to Jekyll so I can write using iA Writer. Work in progress.

### To-Do
1. Fix image alignment
2. Make a non-photo image class
3. Make an outline class or something to help diagrams stand out
4. Use typecast to pick good h2 and h3
5. Check again on iPad
6. Think about a way to step through blog articles, next, previous
7. ~~Get the basic blog up on Heroku to test~~
8. Start to think about /blog - multiple posts on one page
9. Long finger = comments.
