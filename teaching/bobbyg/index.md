Where to go to learn more and more about CSS.

* [CSS Property Index](http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/css/propindex/all.htm) - Every standard CSS property with descriptions of possible values and usage.
* [Mozilla Developer Network CSS Property List](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/CSS_Reference) - Like the above, but it looks nicer.
* [Mozilla Developer Network CSS tutorials and reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS) - Mozilla has a lot of great learning materials.
* **Browser Specific References** Browsers are moving faster than the official CSS specification, so you'll see rules like `-webkit-box-shadow`. Chrome and Safari both use Webkit, Firefox does it's own thing. Combining rules from these two links will help your site appear the same in all of those 3 browsers.
